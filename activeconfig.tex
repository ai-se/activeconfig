\section{Introduction}
 
%==Are these comments?== 
%Are feature/variability models too abstract for concrete reasoning?
%Or is it possible to use these models to predict specific properties 
%of programs generated from them? 

Most software systems today are configurable. Despite the undeniable benefits
of configurability, 
large configuration spaces challenge developers, maintainers, and users. In the face of hundreds of configuration options, it is difficult to keep track of the effects of individual configuration options and their mutual interactions. So, predicting the performance of individual system configurations or determining the optimal configuration is often more guess work than engineering. In their recent paper, Xu et al.\ documented the  difficulties developers face
with understanding  the configuration spaces of their systems~\cite{xu2015hey}. As a result, developers tend to ignore over $5/6$ths of the configuration options, which leaves considerable optimization potential untapped and induces major economic cost~\cite{xu2015hey}.

Addressing the challenge of performance prediction and optimization in the face of large configuration spaces, researchers have developed a number of approaches that rely on sampling and machine learning~\cite{siegmund2012predicting,guo2013variability,sarkar2015cost}.
While gaining some ground, state-of-the-art approaches face two problems: 
(a)~they require far too many sample configurations for learning or (b)~they are prone to large variances in their predictions. For example, prior work on predicting performance scores using regression-trees had to compile and execute hundreds to thousands of specific system configurations~\cite{guo2013variability}. 
% Other studies that tried to make far fewer execution samples resulted in predictors that were considerably inaccurate in their performance predictions.\todo[inline]{Which do you mean?}
A more balanced approach by Siegmund et al.\ is able to learn predictors for  configurable systems~\cite{siegmund2012predicting} with low mean errors, but with large variances of prediction accuracy  (e.g.\ in half of the results, the performance predictions for the Apache Web server were up to 50\,\% wrong). 
%My(Norbert) comment on this: you can't just take the worst heuristic here when the paper was about improving over this worst case...
 %\footnote{The predictions of \cite{siegmund2012predicting} had $\mu=19\%$ errors with $\sigma = 19.5\%$.}
  %that half they time, they could be up to 50\% incorrect\footnote{
 %The range  $\mu \pm 1.5*\sigma$  includes the
 %25th to 75th percentile range of a normal distribution   
%For the \cite{siegmund2012predicting} errors, that range is  0 to 49\%.}. 
% >> Where do you have this data from? Does not match with the paper.
% Vivek: You take the fault rate and standard deviation of the method which uses **almost** same  number of measurements. 
Guo et al.~\cite{guo2013variability} also proposed an incremental method to build a predictor model, which uses incremental random samples with steps equal to the number of configuration options (features) of the system. This approach also
suffered from  unstable predictions (e.g., predictions had a mean error of up to 22\,\%, with a standard deviation of up 46\,\%). Finally, Sarkar et al.~\cite{sarkar2015cost} proposed a proj\-ective-learning approach (using fewer measurements than Guo at al.\ and Siegmund et al.) to quickly compute  the number of sample configurations for learning a stable predictor. However, as we will discuss, after making that prediction, the total number of samples required for learning the predictor is comparatively high (up to hundreds of samples).

The problems of large sample sets and large variances in prediction can be avoided using the \what spectral learner, which is our main contribution.  
{\what}'s innovation is  the use of the spectrum (eigenvalues) of the distance matrix
between the configurations of a configurable system, to perform dimensionality reduction. Within that
reduced configuration space, many closely associated configurations can be studied
by measuring only a few samples.
In a number of experiments, we compared \what against the state-of-the-art approaches of Siegmund et al.~\cite{siegmund2012predicting}, Guo et al.~\cite{guo2013variability}, and Sarkar et al. \cite{sarkar2015cost} by means of six real-world configurable systems: Berkeley DB,  the Apache Web server, SQLite, the LLVM compiler, and the x264 video encoder.
We found that \what performs as well or better than prior approaches,
while  requiring far fewer samples (just a few dozen).
This is significant and most surprising, since some of the systems explored here have up to millions of possible configurations. 

Overall, we make the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item We present a novel sampling and learning approach for predicting the performance of software configurations in the face of large configuration spaces. The approach is based on a
{\em spectral
learner} that uses an approximation to the first principal component of the configuration space to recursively cluster it, relying only on a few points as representatives of each cluster.
\item We demonstrate the practicality and generality of our approach by conducting experiments on six real-world configurable software systems (see Figure ~\ref{fig:systems}). The results show that our approach is more accurate (lower mean error) and more stable (lower standard deviation) than state-of-the-art approaches.
\item We report on a comparative analysis of our approach and three state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating that our approach outperforms previous approaches in terms of sample size and prediction stability. A key finding is the utility of the principal component of a configuration space to  find informative samples from a large configuration space.
\end{itemize}
%More generally, this paper illustrates the value of spectral learning for software-engineering data sets. We recommend spectral learning for any analytics
%tasks with many options described by sets of attributes
%that might be noisy or redundant. For further details on why we make this recommendation, see Section~\ref{sect:sample}.

%The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the terms used in the paper. Section 3 describes the background of the problem we are trying to tackle along with the data sets used in the experiments. Section 4 further explores the research question and finds association among them. Section 5 describes the experiment setup etc. Section 6 discusses the results and Section 7 the related work. This paper concludes after mentioning the threats to validity.
 
\section{Background \& Related Work}  
\label{sect:addit}

A configurable software system has a set $X$ of Boolean configuration options,\footnote{In this paper, we concentrate on Boolean options, as they make up the majority of all options; see Siegmund et al., for how to incorporate numeric options~\cite{SGA+15}.} also referred to as features or independent variables in our setting.
We denote the number of features of system $S$ as $n$. The configuration space of $S$ can be represented by a Boolean space $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$, which is denoted by $F$. All valid configurations of $S$ belong to a set $V$, which is represented by vectors $\vec{C_i}$ (with $1\leq i\leq \left\vert{V}\right\vert$) in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$. Each element of a configuration represents a feature, which can either be \emph{True} or \emph{False}, based on whether the feature is selected or not. 
% We denote the number of features in the system as $n$. All the features of a system can be represents a boolean/binary space (${Z}_{2}^{n}$)--- $F$, where $n$ is the number of features of the system. Every software system has a set of valid configurations ($V$) which is represented as a vector $\vec{C} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$
% % http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/892094/notation-for-show-that-a-variable-is-binary
% is Boolean $n$-space i.e. each feature of a configurations is assigned $\mathit{True}$ and $\mathit{False}$ otherwise, based on whether the feature was selected or not.  
Each valid instance of a vector (i.e., a configuration) has a corresponding performance score associated to it. 

The literature offers two approaches to performance prediction of software configurations: a {\em maximal sampling} and a {\em minimal sampling} approach: 
With {\em maximal sampling}, we compile all  possible configurations and record the associated performance scores. 
Maximal sampling  can be impractically slow. For example, the performance data used in this paper required  26 days of CPU time for measuring (and much longer, if we also count the time required for compiling the code prior to execution). 
 Other researchers have commented that,  in 
 real world scenarios, the cost of acquiring the optimal configuration is overly expensive and time consuming \cite{weiss2008maximizing}.
 
 If collecting performance scores of all configurations is impractical,  {\em minimal sampling} 
 can be used to intelligently select and execute just enough configurations (i.e., samples) to build a
 predictive model.
 For example, Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2015performance} approximate the
configuration space as a Fourier series, after which they can derive an expression showing how many configurations must be studied
 to build predictive models with a given error. While a theoretically satisfying result, that approach still needs thousands to hundreds of thousands of executions of sample
 configurations.  

Another set of approaches are the four "additive" {\em minimal sampling} methods of Siegmund et al.~\cite{siegmund2012predicting}.
Their first method, called feature-wise sampling ({\em FW}), is their basic method.
To explain {\em FW}, we note that, from a configurable software system, it is theoretically possible to enumerate many or all of the valid configurations\footnote{Though, in practice, this can be very difficult. For example, in models like the Linux Kernel such an enumeration is practically impossible ~\cite{sayyad13b}.}. 
Since each configuration ($\vec{C_i}$) is a vector of $n$ Booleans, it  is possible to use this information to isolate examples of how much each feature individually contributes to the total run time:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a pair of  configurations $\vec{C_i}$ and $\vec{C}_2$, where $\vec{C}_2$ uses exactly the same features as $\vec{C_i}$, plus one  extra feature $f_i$.
\item Set the run time $\Pi(f_i)$ for feature $f_i$ to be the difference in the performance scores between $\vec{C_2}$ and $\vec{C_i}$.
\item The run time  for a new configuration  $\vec{C}_i$ (with $1\leq i\leq \left\vert{V}\right\vert$) that has not been sampled before is then the sum of the run time of its features, as determined before:
\begin{equation}
  \Pi(C_i) = \sum_{f_j \in C_i}\Pi(f_j)  
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

When many pairs, such as ${\vec{C_1},\vec{C}_2}$, satisfy the criteria of point~1, Siegmund et al.\ used the 
pair that covers the {\em smallest} number of features. Their minimal sampling method, {\em FW},
compiles and executes only these smallest $C_1$ and $C_2$ configurations. 
Siegmund et al.\ also offers three extensions to the basic method, which are based on sampling
not just the smallest $\vec{C_i}$,$\vec{C_2}$  pairs, but also any configurations with {\em interactions} between features. 
All the following minimal sampling policies compile and   execute valid configurations selected via one of three heuristics:

\begin{description}
\item[{\em PW (pair-wise):}] For each pair of features, try to find a configuration that contains the pair and has a minimal number of features selected. 
\item[{\em HO (higher-order):}] Select extra configurations, in which three features, $f_1,f_2,f_3$, are selected if two of the following pair-wise interactions exist: $(f_1,f_2)$ and $(f_2,f_3)$ and $(f_1,f_3)$.
\item[{\em HS (hot-spot):}] Select extra configurations that contain features that are
frequently interacting with other features. 
\end{description}


Guo et al.~\cite{guo2013variability} proposed a progressive random sampling approach, which samples in steps of the number of features of the software system in question. They used the sampled configurations to train a regression tree, which is then used to predict the performance scores of other system configurations. The termination criterion of this approach is based on a heuristic, similar to the {\em PW} heuristics of Siegmund et al. 

Sarkar et al.~\cite{sarkar2015cost} proposed a cost model for predicting the effort (or cost) required to generate an accurate predictive model. The user can use this model to decide whether to go ahead and build the predictive model. This method randomly samples configurations and uses a heuristic based on feature frequencies as termination criterion. The samples are then used to train a regression tree; the accuracy of the model is measured by using a test set (where the size of the training set is equal to size of the test set). One of four projective functions (e.g., exponential) is selected based on how correlated they are to  accuracy measures. The projective function is used to approximate the accuracy-measure curve, and the elbow point of the curve is then used as the optimal sample size. Once the optimal size is known, Sarkar et al.\ uses the approach of Guo et al.\ to build the actual prediction model.  


The advantage of these previous approaches is that, unlike  the results of Zhang et al., they require only dozens to hundreds of samples. Also, like our approach, they do not require to enumerate all configurations, which is important for highly configurable software systems. 
That said, as shown by our experiments (see Section~\ref{sec:experiments}), these approaches produce estimates with  larger mean errors and partially larger variances than our approach. While sometimes the approach by Sarkar et al. results in  models with (slightly)
lower mean error rates, it still requires a considerably larger number of samples (up to hundreds, while \what requires only few dozen).
 
 \section{Approach}

\subsection{Spectral Learning}\label{sect:spect}

The minimal sampling method proposed in this paper is based on a spectral-learning algorithm
that  explores the spectrum (eigenvalues) of the distance matrix between  configurations.
In theory, such spectral learners are an appropriate method to handle noisy, redundant, and tightly inter-connected variables, for the following reasons:
When data sets have many irrelevancies or closely associated data parameters $d$, then
only a few eigenvectors $e$, $e \ll d$  are required to characterize the data.
In that reduced space:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Multiple inter-connected variables $i,j,k \subseteq d$ can be represented
by a single eigenvector;
\item
Noisy variables from $d$ are
ignored, because they  do not contribute to the signal in the data;
\item
Variables  become (approximately) parallel lines
in $e$ space. For  redundancies \mbox{$i,j \in d$}, we
can ignore $j$
since effects that change over $j$ also
change in the same way over $i$;
\end{itemize}
That is, in theory, samples of configurations drawn via an eigenspace sampling method
would not get confused by noisy, redundant, or tightly inter-connected variables. Accordingly,
we expect predictions built from that sample to have  lower mean errors and lower variances on that error.

Spectral methods have been used before for a variety of data mining applications~\cite{kamvar2003spectral}.
Algorithms, such as PDDP~\cite{boley98}, use spectral methods, such as principle component analysis (PCA), to
recursively divide data into smaller regions.  Software-analytics researchers use spectral methods (again, PCA) as a pre-processor prior to data mining  to reduce noise in software-related data sets~\cite{theisen2015approximating}.
However, to the best of our knowledge, spectral methods have not been used before in software engineering as a basis of a minimal sampling method.


\what is somewhat different from other spectral
learners explored in, for instance, image processing applications~\cite{shi00}.
Work on image processing does not address
defining a minimal sampling policy to predict performance scores.
Also, a standard spectral method requires an $O(N^2)$ matrix multiplication to compute the components
of PCA~\cite{ilin10}. Worse, in the case of hierarchical division methods, such as PDDP,
the polynomial-time inference must be repeated at every level of the hierarchy.
Competitive results can be achieved
using an $O(2N)$ analysis that we have developed previously~\cite{me12d}, which is  based on  a heuristic proposed by Faloutsos and Lin~\cite{Faloutsos1995} (which Platt has shown computes a Nystr\"om approximation to the first component of PCA~\cite{platt05}).

% \todo[inline]{This paragraph requires a bit more clarification and a relation to the notation introduced in section 2. What is n? What are examples?}  
Our approach inputs $N$ (with $1\leq \left\vert{N}\right\vert\leq \left\vert{V}\right\vert$)
valid configurations ($\vec{C}$), $N_1,N_2,...$, and then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Picks any
point $N_i$ ($1\leq i \leq\left\vert{N}\right\vert$) at random;
\item
Finds
 the point  {\em West}~$\in N$ that is
furthest away from $N_i$;
\item Finds the point {\em East}~$\in N$
that is furthest from {\em West}.
\end{enumerate}
The line joining {\em East}
and {\em West} is our approximation for the first principal component.
Using the distance calculation shown in Equation~\ref{eq:dist}, 
we define $\delta$ to be the distance between {\em East}
and {\em West}. 
% \todo[inline]{What is $c$? Changed to $\delta$}
\what uses this distance ($\delta$) to divide all the configurations as follows:
The value $x_i$ is the projection of $N_i$
on the line  running  from {\em East} to {\em West}\footnote{The projection of $N_i$ can be calculated in the following way:\newline $a = \mathit{dist}(\mathit{East}, N_i); b = \mathit{dist}(\mathit{West}, N_i);  x_i = \sqrt{\frac{a^2 - b^2 + \delta^2}{2\delta}}$.
}.  We divide
the examples based on the median value of the projection of $x_i$. Now, we have two clusters of data divided based on the projection values (of $N_i$) on the line joining {\em East} and {\em West}. This process is applied recursively on these clusters until a predefined stopping condition. In our study, the  recursive splitting of the $N_i$'s stops when a sub-region
contains less than  $\sqrt{|N|}$ examples.
\begin{equation}
    \mathit{dist}(x, y) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \sqrt{\sum_i(x_i-y_i)^2}& \text{if $x_i$ and $y_i$ is numeric}\\
        \begin{cases}
            0, & \text{ if $x_i = y_i$}\\
            1, & \text{ otherwise}\\
        \end{cases}
        & \text{if $x_i$ and $y_i$ is Boolean}\\
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:dist}
\end{equation}
We explore this approach for three reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\em It is very fast}:
This process requires only $2|n|$ distance comparisons
per level of recursion, which is far less than the $O(N^2)$
required by PCA~\cite{Du2008}
or other  algorithms such as K-Means~\cite{hamerly2010making}.
\item
{\em It is not domain-specific}:
Unlike traditional PCA, our approach is general in that it does not assume that all the variables are numeric. As shown in Equation~\ref{eq:dist},\footnote{In our study, $\mathit{dist}$ accepts configurations ($\vec{C}$) and returns the distance between them. If $x_i$ and $y_i$ $\in \mathbb{R}^n$, then the distance function would be same as the standard Euclidean distance.} we can approximate distances for both numeric and non-numeric data (e.g., Boolean).

\item
{\em It reduces the dimensionality problem}:
This technique explores the underlying dimension (first principal component) without getting confused by noisy, related, and highly associated variables.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spectral Sampling}\label{sect:sample}
When the above clustering method terminates, our  sampling policy (which we will call $S_1$:Random) is then applied:
\begin{description}
\item[{\em Random sampling ($S_1$):}] compile and execute one  configuration,  picked at random, from each leaf cluster;
\end{description}
We use this sampling policy, because (as we will show later) it performs better than:
\begin{description}
\item[{\em East-West sampling ($S_2$):}] compile and execute the {\em East} and {\em West} poles of the leaf clusters;
\item[{\em Exemplar sampling ($S_3$):}] compile and execute all items in all leaves and return the one
with lowest performance score.
\end{description}

Note that $S_3$ is {\em not} a {\em minimal} sampling policy (since it executes all configurations). 
We use it here as one  baseline
against which we can compare the other, more minimal, sampling policies. In the results
that follow, we also compare our 
sampling methods against another baseline using information gathered after executing
all configurations.

\subsection{Regression-Tree Learning}
After collecting the data using one of the sampling policies ($S_1$, $S_2$, or $S_3$), as described in Section \ref{sect:sample}, we  use a CART regression-tree learner~\cite{breiman1984} to build a performance predictor. Regression-tree learners seek the attribute-range split that most increases
our ability to make accurate predictions.
CART explores splits that divide $N$ samples  into two sets  $A$ and $B$, where each set  has a  standard deviation on the target variable of $\sigma_1$ and  $\sigma_2$.
CART finds the ``best'' split defined as the split that minimizes $\frac{A}{N}\sigma_1 + \frac{B}{N}\sigma_2$.
Using this best split, CART divides the data recursively.
 
\newpage
In summary, \what  combines:
\begin{compactitem}
\item
The FASTMAP method of Faloutsos and Lin~\cite{Faloutsos1995};

\item A spectral-learning algorithm initially   inspired by    Boley's PDDP system~\cite{boley98}, which we modify
by replacing  PCA with FASTMAP (called
``WHERE'' in prior work ~\cite{me12d});

\item

\subsection{Research Questions} 

We formulate our research questions in terms of the challenges of
exploring large complex configuration spaces.
Since our model explores the spectral space, our hypothesis is that only a small
number of samples is required to explore the whole space.
However, a prediction model built from a very small sample of the configuration space might
be very inaccurate and unstable, that is, it may exhibit very large mean prediction errors and variances on the prediction error.

%Could be removed if space is needed
Also, if we learn models from small regions of the training data,
it is  possible that a learner will miss {\em trends} in the data
between the sample points. Such trends are useful when building {\em optimizers}
(i.e., systems that input one configuration and propose an alternate
configuration that has, for instance,  a better performance). Such optimizers might
need to evaluate hundreds to millions of alternate configurations. 
To speed up that process, optimizers can use a {\em surrogate model}\,\footnote{Also known as response surface methods, meta models, or emulators.}
that  mimics the outputs of a system of interest, while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate~\cite{loshchilov13}. For example, when optimizing
performance scores, we might ask a CART  for a performance
prediction (rather than compile and execute
the corresponding configuration).  Note that such surrogate-based
reasoning critically depends on how well the surrogate can guide optimization.


Therefore, to assess feasibility of our sampling policies, we must consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item Performance scores generated from our minimal sampling policy;
\item The variance of the error rates when comparing predicted performance scores with actual ones;
%the next point should always be true. otherwise, what would be the reason to do that?!
\item The optimization support offered by the performance predictor (i.e., can the model work in tandem with other off-the-shelf optimizers to generate useful solutions).
\end{itemize}

%\vfill\eject
The above considerations lead to four research questions:
\begin{description}
\item[{\em RQ1:}] {\em Can  \what generate good predictions after
executing only a small number of configurations?}
\end{description}
Here, by ``good'' we mean that the predictions made by models that were trained using sampling with \what are as accurate, or more accurate,
as those generated from models supplied with more samples.
\begin{description}
\item[{\em RQ2:}] {\em
Does less data used in building the models cause larger variances in the predicted values?}
\item[{\em RQ3:}] {\em
Can ``good'' surrogate models (to be used in optimizers)
be built from minimal samples?}
\end{description}
Note that {\bf RQ2} and {\bf RQ3} are of particular concern with our approach,
since our goal is to sample as little as possible from the configuration space.
\begin{description}
\item[{\em RQ4:}] {\em How good is \what compared to the state of the art of
learning performance predictors from configurable software systems?}
\end{description}

To answer RQ4, we will compare \what 
          against approaches presented by Siegmund et al.~\cite{siegmund2012predicting}, Guo et al.~\cite{guo2013variability}, and Sarkar et al.~\cite{sarkar2015cost}.

\subsection{Subject Systems}
\label{sec:subject_systems}
The configurable systems we used in our experiments are described in Figure \ref{fig:systems}.
Note, with ``predicting performance'', we 
mean predicting performance scores of the subject systems while executing test suites provided by the developers or the community, as described in Figure~\ref{fig:systems}.
To compare the predictions of our and prior approaches with actual performance measures, we use data sets that have been obtained by
measuring {\em nearly all} configurations\footnote{http://openscience.us/repo/performance-predict/cpm.html}.
We say {\em nearly all} configurations, for the following reasoning: For 
all except one of our subject systems, the total number of valid configurations
was tractable (192 to 2560). However,  SQLite has 3,932,160 
possible configurations, which is an impractically large number of configurations to test whether our predictions are accurate and stable. Hence, for SQLite, we use the 4500 samples for testing prediction accuracy and stability, which we could collect in one day of CPU time. Taking this into account, we will pay particular attention to the variance of the SQLite results.






\subsection{Experimental Rig}


{\bf RQ1} and {\bf RQ2} require the construction and assessment of numerous runtime predictors from small samples
of the data. The following rig implements that construction process.

For each configurable software system, we built a table of data, one row per valid configuration. We then ran all configurations of all software systems
and recorded the performance scores (i.e., that are invoked by a benchmark).
The exception is SQLite for which we measured only the
configurations needed to detect interactions and additionally
100 random configurations to evaluate the accuracy of
predictions.  
% \todo[inline]{In Subject Systems we say that we use 4500 samples. In general, this discussion is redundant; I would remove it from Subject Systems.}
To this table, we added a column showing the performance score obtained from the actual measurements for each configuration.

Note that the following procedure ensures that
we \textbf{never} test any prediction model on the data used to learn that model. Next, we repeated the following procedure 20 times (the figure of 20 repetitions was
selected using the Central Limit Theorem): 
For each system in \{BDBC, BDBJ, Apache, SQLite, LLVM, x264\}
\begin{itemize}
\item Randomize the order of the rows in their table of data;
\item For $X$ in \{10, 20, 30, ... , 90\};
\begin{itemize}
\item Let {\em Train} be the first $X$\,\% of the data 
\item Let {\em Test} be the rest of the data;
\item Pass {\em Train} to \what to select   sample   configurations;
\item Determine the performance scores associated with these configurations. This corresponds to a table lookup, but would entail compiling and executing a system configuration in a practical setting.
\item Using the {\em Train}  data and their performance scores, build a performance predictor using CART.
\item Using the {\em Test} data, assess the accuracy of the predictor using the error 
measure of \eq{err} (see below).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


% \todo[inline]{Check the correct placement of this paragraph}
The validity of the predictors built by the regression tree is verified on testing data. 
For each  test item, we determine how long it {\em actually} takes to run the corresponding system configuration and compare the actual measured performance to the {\em prediction} from CART. The resulting prediction error is then computed using:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:err}
\mathit{error}=\frac{\mid\mathit{predicted} - \mathit{actual}\mid}{\mathit{actual}}*100
\end{equation}

{\bf RQ2} requires testing the standard deviation of the prediction error rate. To support that test, we:
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine the $X$-th point in the above experiments, where all predictions stop improving (elbow point);
\item Measure the standard deviation of the error at this point, across our 20 repeats.
\end{itemize}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sampling_accuracy}, all our results plateaued after studying $X=40$\,\% of the valid configurations\footnote{Just to clarify one frequently asked question about this work, we note
that our rig ``studies'' 40\,\% of the data. We do not mean that our predictive models
 require accessing the performance scores from the 40\,\% of the data. Rather, by ``study'' we mean   reflect 
 on a sample of configurations to determine what minimal subset of that
sample deserves to be compiled and executed.}.
 Hence to answer {\bf RQ2}, we will compare all 20 predictions at $X=40$\,\%.
 
{\bf RQ3}   uses the learned regression tree as a {\em surrogate model} within an optimizer; 
\bi
\item Take   $X=40\,\%$ of the configurations;
\item Apply \what to build a CART model using some minimal sample taken from that 40\,\%;
\item Use that CART model within some standard optimizer while searching for 
configurations with least runtime;
\item  Compare the faster configurations found in this manner with the fastest configuration
known for that system.
\ei
This last item requires access to a ground truth of performance scores for a  
large number of configurations. For this experiment, we have access to that ground truth
(since we have access to all system configurations, except for SQLite). Note that such a ground truth
would not be needed when practitioners choose to use \what in their own work (it is only for our empirical investigation).


For the sake of completeness, we explored
a range of optimizers seen in the   literature in this second experiment:  DE~\cite{storn1997differential}, NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast},
and our own GALE~\cite{krall2014gale,zuluaga2013active} system.   Normally,
it would be  reasonable to ask
why we used those three, and not the hundreds of other 
optimizers described in the literature~\cite{fletcher13,harman12}. However,
as shown below, all these optimizers in this
domain exhibited  very similar
behavior (all found configurations close to the
best case performance). Hence, the specific
choice of optimizer is not a critical
variable in  our analysis.

\section{Results}




\subsection{RQ1}

\begin{center}
{\em Can  \what generate good predictions after
executing only a small number of configurations?}
\end{center}

\noindent \fig{sampling_accuracy} shows the mean errors of the predictors learned
after taking $X$\,\% of the configurations, then asking  \what and some sampling method ($S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$)
to (a)~find what configurations to measure; then (b)~asking CART to build a predictor
using these measurements. The horizontal axis of the plots shows what $X$\,\%
of the configurations are studied; the vertical axis shows the mean relative error (from \eq{err}).
In that figure:
\begin{compactitem}
\item
The $\times$\hspace{-2pt}---\hspace{-2pt}$\times$ lines in \fig{sampling_accuracy} show a {\em baseline} result
where data from the performance scores of 100\,\% of  configurations were used by CART
to build a runtime predictor.
\item
The other lines show the results using the sampling methods defined in Section~\ref{sect:sample}.
Note that these sampling methods used  runtime data only from a
subset of 100\,\% of the performance scores seen in configurations
from 0 to X\,\%.
\end{compactitem}

% \todo[inline]{PLEASE REMOVE - Actually, RQ1 does not say anything about varying the sampling policy; Furthermore, we have defined: \what =  WHERE $+$ $S_1$:Random $+$ CART, so \what plus S2... makes no sense. Vivek: I have changed the definition of WHAT to sampling policy because we are making a claim that any random point is better. Our recent studies have shown that using using outlier is not a good representative of a cluster}

In \fig{sampling_accuracy}, {\em lower} y-axis values  are {\em better} since this means lower
prediction errors. Overall, we find that:
\begin{itemize}

\item Some software systems exhibit large variances in their error rate, below $X=40$\,\% (e.g., BDBC and BDBJ).
\item Above $X=40$\,\%, there is little effect on the overall change of the sampling methods.
\item
Mostly, $S_3$ shows the highest overall error, 
so that it cannot be recommended.
\item Always, the   $\times$\hspace{-2pt}---\hspace{-2pt}$\times$ baseline shows the lowest errors, which is to be
expected since predictors built on the baseline have access to all data.
\item
We see a trend that the error of  $S_1$ and $S_2$ are within $5$\,\% of the {\em baseline} results.
Hence, we can recommend these two minimal sampling methods.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Figures/evaluation_graph}
\caption{Comparing evaluations of different sampling policies. We see that the number of configurations evaluated for $S_2$ is twice as high as $S_1$, as it selects 2 points from each cluster, where as  $S_1$ selects only 1 point. }\label{fig:Evaluations}
\end{figure}

\fig{Evaluations} provides information about which  of    $S_1$ or $S_2$ we should recommend.
This figure displays data taken from the $X=40$\,\% point of \fig{sampling_accuracy} and displays
how many performance scores of configurations are needed by our sub-sampling methods (while
reflecting on the configurations seen in the range $0\le X \le 40$). Note that:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$S_3$ needs up to thousands of performance-score points, 
so it cannot be recommended as minimal-sampling policy;
\item $S_2$ needs twice as much performance-score information as 
$S_1$ ($S_2$ uses {\em two} samples per leaf cluster  while
$S_1$ uses only {\em one}).
\item $S_1$ needs performance-score information on only a few dozen (or less) configurations to generate
the predictions with the lower errors seen in \fig{sampling_accuracy}.
\end{itemize}
Combining the results of \fig{sampling_accuracy} and \fig{Evaluations}, we conclude that:

\begin{myshadowbox}
$S_1$ is our preferred spectral sampling method. Furthermore,
the answer to {\bf RQ1} is ``yes'', because applying \what{}, we can (a)~generate runtime predictors
using just a few dozens of sample performance scores; 
and (b)~these predictions have error rates
within 5\,\% of the error rates seen if predictors are built from information about all performance scores.
\end{myshadowbox}




\subsection{RQ2}

\begin{center}
{\em
Do less data used in building the models cause larger variances in the predicted values?}
\end{center}


Two competing effects can cause increased or decreased  variances in 
runtime predictions.
The   less we sample the configuration space,
the less we constrain model generation in that space. Hence, one effect that can be expected
is that models learned
from too few samples exhibit large variances. 
But,
a  compensating effect can be introduced by sampling from the spectral space
since that space contains fewer confusing or correlated variables than the raw configuration space.

\fig{Variance} reports which one of these two competing effects are dominant. 
\fig{sampling_accuracy} shows that after some initial fluctuations,
after seeing $X=40$\,\% of the configurations, the variances in prediction errors reduces to nearly zero.


\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Figures/Variance}
\caption{Standard deviations seen at various points of  \fig{sampling_accuracy}.}\label{fig:Variance}
\end{figure}

\begin{myshadowbox}
Hence, we answer {\bf RQ2} with ``no'': Selecting a small number of samples does not necessarily increase variance (at least to say, not in this domain).
\end{myshadowbox}


\subsection{RQ3}

\begin{center}
{\em
Can ``good'' surrogate models (to be used in optimizers)
be built from minimal samples?}
\end{center}

The results of answering {\bf RQ1} and {\bf RQ2} suggest to use \what (with $S_1$) to build runtime predictors from a small sample of  data. {\bf RQ3}
asks if that predictor can be used by an optimizer to infer what {\em other} configurations correspond to system configurations with fast performance scores.
To answer this question,  we ran  a random set of 100 
configurations, 20 times, and related that baseline to three optimizers (GALE~\cite{krall2014gale}, DE~\cite{storn1997differential} and  NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast}) using their
default parameters.
 
When these three optimizers mutated existing configurations to suggest new ones,
these mutations were checked for validity. Any mutants that violated the system's constraints (e.g., a feature excluding another feature) were rejected
and the survivors were ``evaluated'' by asking the CART surrogate model.
%(the  CART regression-tree learned from \what+$S_1$:Random, built using the methods of {\bf RQ1}).
These evaluations either rejected the mutant or used it in generation $i+1$, as the basis for a search for more, possibly
better  mutants.




\fig{performance_graph} shows the configurations found by three optimizers projected onto the ground truth of the performance scores of nearly
all configurations (see Section~\ref{sec:subject_systems}). Again note that, while we use that ground truth for the validation of these results, our optimizers 
used only a small part of that ground-truth data in their search for the fastest configurations (see the \what + $S_1$
results of \fig{Evaluations}).


\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/optimizer_result_g}
\caption{Solutions found by GALE, NSGA-II and DE (shown as points) laid against the ground truth (all known configuration performance scores). 
% In case of Apache and BDBJ, we can see that the different optimizers find different solutions but in the remaining plots, the results are the same. 
It can be observed that all the optimizers can find the configuration with  lower performance scores.}\label{fig:performance_graph}
\end{figure}


The important feature of \fig{performance_graph} is that all the optimized configurations fall within 1\,\% of the fastest
configuration according to the ground truth (see all the left-hand-side dots on each plot). Table~\ref{fig:external_validity} compares the performance of the optimizers
used in this study. Note that the performances are nearly identical, which leads to the following conclusions:

\begin{myshadowbox}
The answer to {\bf RQ3} is ``yes'': For optimizing performance scores, we can use surrogates built from few runtime samples. The choice of the optimizer does not critically effect this conclusion.
\end{myshadowbox}


\begin{table}[tbh]
\caption{The table shows how the minimum performance scores as found by the learners GALE, NSGA-II, and DE, vary over 20 repeated
runs. Mean values are denoted $\mu$ and IQR denotes the 25th--75th percentile. A low IQR suggests that the surrogate model build by \what is stable and can be utilized by off the shelf optimizers to find performance-optimal configurations.

\subsection{RQ4}


% \todo[inline]{change fault rate to error rate. note the sampling heuristic used for siegmund (I guess FW?!)}

 \begin{center}
{\em How good is \what compared to the state of the art of learning performance predictors from configurable software systems?}
\end{center}

We compare \what with the three state-of-the-art predictors proposed in the literature~\cite{siegmund2012predicting}, \cite{guo2013variability}, \cite{sarkar2015cost}, as discussed in Section~\ref{sect:addit}. Note that all approaches use regression-trees as predictors, except Siegmund's approach, which uses a regression function derived using linear programming.
 
 The \framebox{\colorbox{whatcolor}{\textcolor{whatcolor}{\bf blue}}} bars of Figure \ref{fig:Comparison} show the
 mean error rate, the standard deviation of the error rate, and the mean percentage
 of total configurations used in 30 repeats of the different approaches.
 Note that the y-axis of that figure is a logarithmic scale so, within each plot:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Differences near the bottom  are very small differences;
 \item Differences near the top   are very large differences;
 \end{itemize}
 
As seen in the left and middle plots of
Figure~\ref{fig:Comparison}, 
the {\em FW} approach of Siegmund et al.\ (i.e., the sampling approach using the fewest number of configurations) often has the highest
error rate and the highest
standard deviation on that error rate. Hence,
we cannot recommend this method or,  if one wishes to use this method, we recommend using the other sampling heuristics (e.g., HO, HS) to make more accurate predictions (but at the cost of much more measurements). Moreover, the size of the standard deviation of this method causes further difficulties in estimating which configurations are those exhibiting a large prediction error. 

As to the approach of Guo et al.\ (with PW), this   does not standout on any of
our measurements. Its error results are within 1\,\% of \what;
 its standard deviation are usually larger; and it requires
 much more data than \what.
 
 In terms of the number of measured samples required to build a model, 
 the right-hand-side plot of  Figure~\ref{fig:Comparison}  shows that
 \what requires the fewest samples except for two cases:
 the approach of Guo et al. (with 2N) working on BDBC and LLVM.  In both these cases, the mean error and standard deviation on the error
 estimate is   larger than \what  (see the \framebox{\colorbox{guocolor}{\textcolor{guocolor}{\bf red}}} bars in the left and middle plots   of Figure~\ref{fig:Comparison}). Furthermore, in the case of BDBC, the error values
 are $\mu=14\,\%$, $\sigma=13\,\%$, which are much larger
than \what{}'s error scores of $\mu=6\,\%$, $\sigma=5\,\%$. 


Although the approach of Sarkar et al.\ produces an error rate that is sometimes less than the one of \what (see the left-hand-side of
Figure~\ref{fig:Comparison}), it requires the most number of measurements. Moreover, \what's accuracy is close to Sarkar's approach (1\,\%
to 2\,\% difference). Hence, we cannot recommend this approach, too.

%Nor can we recommend the approach of Sarkar et al.\ since,
%as shown on the right-hand-side of Figure~\ref{fig:Comparison}, 
%this approach requires the most data.
%While it is true that its error rate 
%is sometimes less than the one of \what (see the left-hand-side of
%Figure~\ref{fig:Comparison}), that difference is often small (1\,\%
%to 2\,\%). 

%The exception here is BDBC, where Sarker's approach has the lowest
%error of any approach. This exception is discussed further in the
%next paragraph.
 

The right-hand-side of Figure~\ref{fig:Comparison}   shows
the {\em percent} of required measurements. Table~\ref{tab:measurements} shows the same
expressed as absolute values. We see that most state-of-the-art approaches often require many more samples than
\what{}.  Using those fewest numbers of samples, \what has
within 1 to 2\,\% of the lowest standard deviation rates 
and within 1 to 2\,\% of lowest error rates.
The exception is Sarkar's approach, which has 5\,\% lower mean error
rates (in BDBC, see the left-hand-side plot of Figure~\ref{fig:Comparison}).  However, 
as shown in right-hand-side of Table~\ref{tab:measurements}, Sarkar's approach needs nearly three times
more measurements than \what (191 vs 64 samples). Given
the overall reduction of the error is   small (5\,\% difference
between Sarkar and \what in mean error), the overall
cost of tripling the data-collection cost is
often not feasible in a practical context and might not justify the small additional benefit in accuracy.

\section{Reliability and Validity}\label{sect:construct}

{\em Reliability} refers to the consistency of the results obtained
from the research.  For example,   how well independent researchers
could reproduce the study? To increase external
reliability, this paper has taken care to either  clearly define our
algorithms or use implementations from the public domain
(SciKitLearn)~\cite{scikit-learn}. Also, all the data used in this work is available
on-line in the PROMISE code repository and all our algorithms
are on-line at github.com/ai-se/where.

{\em Validity} refers to the extent to which a piece of research actually
investigates what the researcher purports to investigate~\cite{SSA15}.
{\em Internal validity} checks if the differences found in
the treatments can be ascribed to the treatments under study. 

One internal validity issue with our experiments is the choice
of {\em training and testing} data sets discussed in 
\fig{systems}. Recall that while all our learners used the same
{\em testing} data set, our untuned learners were only given
access to {\em training} data.

Another internal validity issues is {\em instrumentation}. The very low $\mu$ and $\sigma$ error values
reported in this study are so small that it is reasonable to ask whether they are due to some instrumentation
quirk, rather than due to using a clever sample strategy:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Our low $\mu$ values are consistent with prior work (e.g.~\cite{sarkar2015cost});
\item
As to our low $\sigma$ values, we note that, when the  error values are so close to 0\,\%, the standard
deviation of the error is ``squeezed'' between zero and those errors. Hence, we would expect that
experimental rigs
that generate error values on the order of 5\,\% and \eq{err} should have $\sigma$ values of $0\le \sigma \le 5$ (e.g., like those seen in our introduction).
\end{itemize}

Regarding SQLite, we cannot measure all possible configurations in reasonable time. Hence, we sampled only 100 configurations to compare prediction and actual performance values. We are aware that this evaluation leaves room for outliers.
Also, we are aware that measurement bias can cause false interpretations~\cite{me12d}. Since we aim at predicting performance for a special workload, we do not have to vary benchmarks.



  We aimed at increasing the {\em external validity} by choosing software systems from different domains with different configuration mechanisms and implemented with different programming languages. Furthermore, the systems used are deployed and used in the real world. Nevertheless, assuming the evaluations to be automatically transferable  to all configurable software systems is not fair. To further strengthen external validity, we run the model (generated by \textit{\what + $S_1$}) against other optimizers, such as NSGA-II and differential evolution~\cite{storn1997differential}. That is, we validated whether the learned models are not only applicable for GALE style of perturbation. In Table~\ref{fig:external_validity}, we see that the models developed are valid for all optimizers, as all optimizers are able to find the near optimal solutions.



\section{Related Work}
\label{sect:related}
 
In 2000, Shi and Maik~\cite{shi00} claimed the term ``spectral clustering'' as a reference to their normalized cuts
image
segmentation algorithm that  partitions data through a spectral (eigenvalue) analysis of the  
Laplacian representation of the similarity graph between instances in the data.

In 2003, Kamvar et al.~\cite{kamvar2003spectral}  generalized that definition saying that ``spectral learners''
were any data-mining algorithm that first replaced the raw
dimensions with those inferred from the spectrum (eigenvalues) of the affinity (a.k.a.\ distance)
matrix of the data, optionally adjusted via some normalization technique).

Our clustering based on first principal component splits the data on a   approximation to an eigenvector, found at each recursive level
of the data (as described in \tion{spect}). 
Hence, this  method is a ``spectral clusterer'' in the general Kamvar sense. 
Note that,
for our data, we have
not found that Kamvar's normalization matrices are needed.

Regarding sampling, there are a wide range of methods know as experimental designs or designs of experiments~\cite{pukelsheim2006optimal}. They usually rely on fractional factorial designs as in the combinatorial testing community~\cite{Kuhn:2013}. 

Furthermore, there is a recent approach that learns {\em per\-for\-mance-influence models} for configurable software systems~\cite{SGA+15}. While this approach can handle even numeric features, it has similar sampling techniques for the Boolean features as reported in their earlier work~\cite{siegmund2012predicting}. Since we already compared to that earlier work and do not consider also numeric features, we did not compare our work to performance-influence models.
% (but perhaps if we were text mining
%on very large dimensional data, we would add in that normalization). 
 



\section{Conclusions}

Configurable software systems today are widely used in practice, but expose challenges regarding finding performance-optimal configurations. State-of-the-art approaches require too many measurements or are prone to large variances in their performance predictions. To avoid these shortcomings, we have proposed a fast spectral learner, called \what,  along with three new sampling techniques. The key idea of \what is to explore the configuration space with eigenvalues of the features used in a configuration to determine exactly those configurations for measurement that reveal key performance characteristics. 
This way, we can study many closely associated configurations with only a few measurements.

We evaluated our approach on six real-world configurable software systems borrowed from the literature. Our approach achieves similar to lower error rates, while being stable when compared to the state of the art. In particular, with the exception of Berkeley DB, our approach is more accurate than the state-of-the-art approaches by Siegmund et al.~\cite{siegmund2012predicting} and Guo et al.~\cite{guo2013variability}. Furthermore, we achieve a similar prediction accuracy and stability as the approach by Sarkar et al~\cite{sarkar2015cost}, while requiring a far smaller number of configurations to be measured. We also demonstrated that our approach can be used to build cheap and stable surrogate prediction models, which can be used by off-the-shelf optimizers to find the performance-optimal configuration. 

%Our specific focus here was on sampling data
%to reason about configurable software systems. More generally,
%this paper has demonstrated the benefit of using
%spectral learning for SE applications.  As argued in \tion{sample},
%we recommend spectral learning  for software analytics when there are
%are many possible options described by sets of attributes
%that might be noisy or redundant.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Evolutionary optimization algorithms} \label{ssec:appendix_1}
starts with an \textit{initial population} (randomly generated, based on some constraints). Since the solutions are drawn from a uniform distribution, typically, this diversity is desirable, although in some cases we might want to initialize all of the available parents to some best-known solution and proceed from there. The chosen \textit{evaluation function} must be capable of differentiating
between two individuals, i.e., it has to be able to rank one solution ahead
function, are favored to become parents for the next generation of offspring. 
A core function in evolutionary optimizers are the
\textit{reproduction} functions that generate   new solutions  probabilistically in the neighborhood of old solutions. This process continues till the a \"good enough\" solution is achieved or a hard limit on iterations are reached.  
    
    There has been extensive research in evolutionary algorithms in search-based software engineering.  For example, here is a list of search algorithms used widely in research: \textit{simulated annealing}\cite{bell2013limited, menzies2007business}; various genetic algorithms\cite{goldberg1979complexity} agumented by techniques such as
    (1)~smarter population subset selection~\cite{zit02,deb00afast};
    (2)~\textit{differential evolution} \cite{storn1997differential}
    (3)~\textit{tabu search and scatter search}\cite{nebro2008abyss, molina2007sspmo, glover1986general, beausoleil2006moss}; 
    (4)~\textit{particle swarm optimization}\cite{pan2008particle}; 
    (5)~numerous decomposition approaches that use heuristics to decompose the total space into small problems, then apply a response surface methods such
    as our own GALE\cite{krall2014gale,zuluaga2013active} algorithm.
    
    For this study, we applied three optimizers that are standards
    in the SE literature (NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast} and SPEA2~\cite{zit02})
    as well as our own GALE algorithm~\cite{krall2014gale}).
    GALE uses the WHERE algorithm to find a direction of most useful
    mutation. Given leaf clusters, each with an {\em East,West} point
    then 
    GALE mutates the population of candidates in that leaf cluster towards
    which of {\em East,West} has better evaluation scores. These
    mutants become the data  that is cluster
    and mutated by WHERE in  generation $i+1$.
    
\subsection{Parameter Used}
We used the default parameters for NSGA-II and Differential Evolution (as recommended by the authors) where as the parameters used by GALE are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mu$ = 100: population size;
\item $\omega$ = $\mu$: minimum size leaf clusters;
\item $\lambda$ = 3: premature stopping criteria (sets the maximum
allowed generations without any improvement
on any objective).
\item $\delta$ = 1: the ``accelerator'' that encourages larger
mutations;
\item $\gamma$ = 1.5: the ``brake'' that blocks excessive mutation.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Parameter Bias} 
For this study, we did not do extensive parameter tuning:
NSGA-II and DE were run using their default
settings while GALE was run using the settings that
worked well on the first model we studied, which were
then frozen for the rest of this study. As documented
above, those parameters were:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mu$ = 100: population size;
\item $\omega$ = $\mu$: minimum size leaf clusters;
\item $\lambda$ = 3: premature stopping criteria (sets the maximum
allowed generations without any improvement
on any objective).
\item $\delta$ = 1: the ``accelerator'' that encourages larger
mutations;
\item $\gamma$ = 1.5: the ``brake'' that blocks excessive mutation.
\end{itemize}

If this paper was arguing that these parameters were
somehow optimal, then it would be required to present
experiments defending the above settings. However, our
claim is less than that—we only aim to show that with
these settings, GALE does as well than standard searching
tools. In future work, we will explore other settings.
