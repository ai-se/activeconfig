Prior work on predicting runtimes from products generated from
software product lines suffered from either (a)~needing far to many samples
of running programs or (b)~large variances in their predictions.
Both these problems can be avoided using the WHAT
spectral learner. 
WHAT  uses the spectrum (eigenvalues) of a distance matrix
between configurations to perform dimensionality reduction. Within that
reduced space, many closely associated configurations can be studied
via the execution of just a few samples; e.g. for the programs studied
here, a few dozen samples yielded accurate predictors (less than 10\% error)
that were very stable (standard deviations usually less than 3\%).  
Also, when compared to a prior state of the art result, this method (a)~required  
25\% to 50\% less samples 
and (b)~its predictions are   four to sixteen times more accurate (i.e. much mean errors
and 
standard deviations on the errors). 
{\bf XXX VIVEK CHECK and also in  the text say where we get to a and b}  
Further, the predictive model generated by
WHERE can be used by optimizers to discover new configurations that closely
approach the minimum runtimes of all possible configurations for a software system.

\section{Introduction}
 
 Are software  product line models too abstract for concrete reasoning?
Or is it possible to use these product lines to predict specific properties 
of programs generated from the product line? 

Software product line models are highly level descriptions of the commonalities and variabilities   across related software systems. They can be used to derive a set of approaches for software implementation. 
They have received much attention in the literature.
For example, the 1990 Kang feature models article (that describes one notation for product lines) has over 4600 citations~\cite{kang1990feature} and os the basis for 
much recent work~\cite{lopez15,harman14,sayyad13a,sayyad13b}).

 Product lines can be used to make general conclusions about trade-offs between different features~\cite{sayyad13a,sayyad13b}. 
But it is harder to use
such product lines to more specific make
predictions about, say, the expected software runtimes of planned products. 
For example, prior work on predicting runtimes from product lines had  to compile and execute
hundreds to thousands of specific products~\cite{guo2013variability}. 
Other studies, that tried to make do with   far fewer execution samples, resulted
in predictors that were
 wildly inaccurate in their runtime predictions.
Seigmund et al. in 2012 built predictors for a product line description of the Apache web server~\cite{siegmund2012predicting}. Their resulting predictor had low moderately low mean errors   but those predictions
 were  so  unstable\footnote{Prediction errors in prior  work: $(\mu,\sigma)=(15,25)$\%} that half they time, they could be up to 50\% incorrect\footnote{
 The range  $\mu \pm 1.5*\sigma$  includes the
 25th to 75th percentile range of a normal distribution   
For the Seigmund et al. errors, that range is  0 to 52.5\%.}.
 

This paper presents WHAT, a {\em spectural learner}     that finds very
accurate and  stable predictions of products generated from  product lines.
WHAT explores the spectrum (eigenvalues) of a distance matrix
between  configurations to perform dimensionality reduction. The reduced
space is then queried to find a small number of representative examples which are used to
build a predictive model for runtimes (using a decision tree learner~\cite{breiman1984}).
For the product line descriptions tested here (Berkely database, the Apache web server, SQL, the LLVM compiler, the x264 video encoder),
those predictions are three times more accurate than those of Seigmund et al. as well
as have a much lower variance\footnote{Prediction errors in this paper: $(\mu,\sigma) = (5,1)$\%.}.


Significantly, our predictions were found using   very few samples of runtime behavior
(runtime data on 16 to 64 executions).
This is most significant and most surprising  since the product lines explored here have up
to millions of possible variations. 

This is a result with a large industrial utility.
In their recent paper ``Hey, You Have Given Me Too Many Knobs!: Understanding and Dealing with Over-Designed Configuration in System Software'', Xu et al.~\cite{xu2015hey} document the  difficulties developers face
with understanding  the configuration options of their systems.
Delivered systems have large numbers of configuration options, and the number of  configuration options tends to grow linearly
with time. Consequently, developers  struggle to understand both the current options as well as all the new options.
As a result, developers tend to ignore over $\frac{5}{6}$ths of the configuration options. 
This poor understanding of the space of configuration options has an economic cost:  for one system (Hadoop clusters),  Xu et al. report that ``configuration
issues are the dominant source of support cost''~\cite{xu2015hey}. 
Based on the Xu et al. study, it is clear that developers need better tools for understanding the 
consequences of all the configuration options (e.g. such as   the tools of this paper).



The rest of this paper is structured as follows. The next section introduces
product lines (expressed as feature models) and discusses why a spectral learner can
quickly sample those models. {\bf XXX echo paper
structure here}

\textcolor{red}{The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1.1 defines the terms used in the paper. Section 2 describes the background of the problem we are trying to tackle along with the datasets used in the experiments. Section 3 further explores the research question and finds association among them. Section 4 describes the experiment setup etc. Section 5 discusses the results and section 6 discusses the related works. The paper concludes after mentioning the threats to validity.}

\subsection{Definitions}

{\bf XXX VIVEK: clean up oyr
runtimes of some phenomena defined in a test
set}
Note that, by   ``predicting runtimes'', we 
\textcolor{red}{mean predicting performance measures of the system while executing the test suite provided by the system. Given below are details about the performance measure for each system \cite{siegmund2012predicting}:
\begin{description}
\item[Apache]: The \textbf{request rate} at which the web server can no longer respond.
\item[BDBC, BDBJ, SQLite]: The \textbf{time} required to execute the vendor specific benchmark. 
\item[LLVM]: The \textbf{time} LLVM needs to compile its standard test suite. 
\item[x264]:The \textbf{time} needed to encode the video trailer Sintel (735 MB). 
\end{description}}
\st{mean predicting
runtimes of a test suite supplied with a system. Further, when we say ``predicting runtimes
of different configurations'', we mean predicting the runtimes of the different products
with respect to that test suite.  That is, we do not  predict runtimes with respect
to all possible inputs and operating system loads. Rather, we  mean predicting
the change in runtimes (on some fixed reference test suite) that result from using different
parts of a product line.}

These definitions tie our results to particular test suites.
If that test suite was to change, then a  new
runtime study would need  to be conducted. Ideally, such new predictors
can be quickly built using very few additional samples-- in which case, the methods
of this paper would be most relevant.

\section{Background}  

\subsection{Product Lines as Feature Models}
We represent product lines using Kang's feature model (FM) notation. 
As shown in, Figure ~\ref{fig:bdbc}, a feature model defines all valid feature combinations of a customizable system. As shown in the figure a feature model can be presented as a tree like structure that defines relationships among features.   The features on the software system is represented as a set of binary decision variables. A feature, when turned on, corresponds to 1, and 0 otherwise. All the features of a system is represented a {\em configuration} vector  $C_i= <f_1, f_2, ...,f_N>$, where N is the number of features of the software system.  
    
Feature models can be far more elaborate than \fig{bdbc}. 
A feature model of the LINUX kernel~\cite{sayyad13b} contains thousands of features and hundreds of thousands of  {\em cross-tree constraints}; i.e. choices in one branch that rule out choices in other branches. 
Without those constraints, it takes linear time to generate possible products via a simple
top-down descent of the model. With those constraints, product generation becomes NP-hard and can
 defeat state-of-the-art theorem provers~\cite{pohl11} (particularly for larger feature models).
 
 
 
In practice, not all feature models are as complex as  LINUX.
\fig{subjectsystems} details the feature models used in this study. While
they seem to be small (just a few dozen features), the last column in that table lists hundreds
to millions of configurations they can generate.


\subsection{Predicting Runtimes}\label{sect:addit}
How can we predict the runtimes of products generated from such high-level descriptions
as \fig{bdbc}? The literature offers two approaches: a {\em maximal sampling} and a {\em minimal sampling} method.

In the {\em maximal sampling} method, we compile all  configuration variants and record the associated runtimes. Maximal sampling  can be impractically slow.
For example, the software runtime data used in this paper required  26 days of CPU to collect (and much longer, if we also count the time required
 for compiling the code prior to execution). 
 Other researchers have commented that,  in 
 real world scenarios, the cost of acquiring optimal configuration is overly expensive and time consuming \cite{weiss2008maximizing}.
 
 When collecting runtimes on all configurations is impractical,  some {\em minimal sampling } method
 is required to intelligently select and execute   just enough configurations samples to build
 predictive models.
 Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2015performance} approximate the
 systems as a Fourier series, after which they can derive an expression showing how many configurations must be studies {\bf XXX VIVEK check}
 \textcolor{red}{What you have mentioned here is right but, the paper doesn't use the same system that we use. They use something called as hybrid systems because they believe the the number of samples required for their technique to work is larger than the valid domain. " Although this dependency on n is very good for
large systems, for the small data sets we have, the required
number of samples is more than the entire valid domain for
any reasonable accuracy parameters due to the constant hidden
in the O(n) notation." page5- last paragraph}
 to build predictive models with error $\epsilon$. While a theoretically satisfying result, that approach still needs thousands to hundreds of thousands of executions of sample
 configurations.  
 
  {\bf XXX VIVEK check}
  
 {\bf norbert, sven, please fix the following text in this section}.
 
Another set of approaches are the four "additive" {\em minimal sampling} methods for Seigmund et al.~\cite{siegmund2012predicting}.
Their first method, called feature-wise (FW) is their basic method and 
Three of these methods are    elaborations of their basic method, called feature-wise (FW)
selection.

To explain FW, we note that from a product line, it is possible to enumerate all (or many) of the legal configurations. Each such
configuration is a vector of $n$ booleans where $n_i$ indicates if this configuration uses feature $n_i$ (and
an example of ``feature'', see the leaf nodes of \fig{bdbc}).
Using this information it  is possible to isolate examples of how much each feature individually contributes to the total runtime:
\be
\item Find a pair of  configurations $C_1,C_2$  where $C_2$ uses exactly the same features as $C_1$, plus just one  extra feature $f$.
\item Set the runtime $\Pi(f)$ for feature $f$ to be the difference in the runtimes between $C_2$ and $C_1$.
\item The runtime  for a new configuration  $C_i=\{f_1,f_2,f_3,,,\}$, that has not been sampled before,  is the sum of the runtime of its features; i.e.
\[\Pi(C_i) = \sum_{f_j\inC_i}\Pi(f_j)\]
\ee
Further to the first point, when many pairs $C_1,C_2$ satisfy the criteria of point~1, Seigmud et al. used the 
pair that mentions the {\em smallest} number of features. Their basic {\em FW} minimal sampling method 
just compiles and executes just these smallest $C_1,C_2$ configurations. 

Seigmud et al. also offered three extensions to the basic method. All these extensions are based on sampling
not just the smallest $C_1,C_2$  pairs but also any configurations with {\em interactions}. 
All the following minimal sampling policies compile and   execute legal configurations selected via one of three heuristics:
\bi
\item[{\em PW (pair-wise):}] Given the space of all configurations, if two configurations contain the same pairs of setting to features, 
ignore one of the them. 
\item[{\em HO (higher-order):}] Select extra configurations that 
mention three features $a,b,c$ where   $(a,b)$ and $(b,c)$ and $(a,c)$ are known pair-wise features.
\item[{\em HS (hot-spot features):}] Select extra configurations that contains features that are used very
frequently along with features that are rarely used. 
\ei
These extra samples were used as follows. XXX

The advantage of these additive methods are that, unlike  Zhang et al. these additive methods require only dozens to hundreds of samples. That said, as shown by the experiments later in this
paper, they produce estimates with large mean error and larger variance than the WHAT method proposed by
this paper.
 

\subsection{Spectral Learning}\label{sect:spect}

{\bf XXX VIVEK is it safe to call this spectral learning}
\textcolor{red}{From what I can understand any method which tried to find the eigen vector of the distance matrix can be construed as a spectral learner. I feel that we can confidently say that WHERE is a spectral learner}
The minimal sampling method explored in this paper is based on a spectral learning algorithm
that  explore the spectrum (eigenvalues) of a distance matrix between  configurations.
In theory, such spectral learners are a better way to handle noisy, redundant and tightly inter-connected variables, for the following reasons.
When data sets have many irrelevancies   or closely associated data parameters $d$, then
only a few $e \ll d$ eigenvectors are required to characterize that data.
In that reduced space:
\bi
\item
Multiple inter-connected variables $i,j,k \subseteq d$ can be represented
by a single eigenvector.
\item
Noisy variables from $d$ are
ignored since they  do not contribute to the signal in the data.
\item
Variables  become (approximately) parallel lines
in $e$ space. For  redundancies \mbox{$i,j \in d$}, we
can ignore $j$
since effects that change over $j$ also
change in the same way over $i$.
\ei
That is, in theory, samples of configurations drawn via an eigenspace sampling method
would not be confused by noisy, redundant or tightly inter-connected variables. Accordingly,
we might expect predictions built from that sample to have  lower mean errors and lower variances on that error.

Spectral methods have been used before for a variety of data mining applications~\cite{kamvar2003spectral}.
Algorithms like PDDP~\cite{boley98} use spectral methods such as principle component analysis (PCA) to
recursively divide data into smaller regions.  Software analytics researchers like Theisen et al.~\cite{Theisen15} (amongst
others) use spectral methods (again, PCA) as a pre-processor prior to data mining in order to reduce noise in software-related data sets.
However, to the best of our knowledge, spectral methods have not been used before in software engineering as a basis 
of a minimal sampling policy.




WHAT is somewhat different to other spectral
learners explored in, say, image processing applications~\cite{shi00}.
Those image processing papers do not address
our key contribution presented in this paper  (defining
 a minimal sampling policy to predict runtimes).
Also,
standard spectral method requires some $O(N^2)$ matrix multiplication to compute, say, the components
of PCA~\cite{ilin10}. Worse, in the case of hierarchical division methods like PDDP,
that polynomial time inference must be repeated at every level of the hierarchy.
Competitive results can be achieved
using an $O(2N)$ analysis we have developed previously~\cite{me12d}, that is  based on  a heuristic proposed by
Faloutsos and Lin~\cite{Faloutsos1995}
(which
Platt has
  shown computes a Nystr\"om
  approximation to the first component of
  PCA~\cite{platt05}).
  
  This approach inputs
$n$
examples $n_1,n_2,..$. The FASTMAP heuristic
picks any
point $n_i$ at random then  finds
 the point  {\em West}~$\in n$ that is
furthest away\footnote{
 For this work, we use the standard Euclidean measure recommended for
instance-based reasoning by Aha et al.~\cite{aha91};
i.e. $\sqrt{\sum_i(x_i-y_i)^2}$ where $x_i,y_i$
are values normalized 0..1 for the range min..max.}
from $n_i$.
FASTMAP then
finds the point {\em East}~$\in n$
that is furthest from {\em West}.
We say that the line between {\em West} and {\em East} has  length  
$c=\mathit{dist}(\mathit{West},\mathit{East})$.
Using this  approach, WHAT uses FASTMAP recursively to divide all the configurations as follows.
We iterate over $n_i \in n$
to find
$a=\mathit{dist}(n_i,\mathit{West})$,
$b=\mathit{dist}(n_i,\mathit{East})$,
$x=(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)/(2c)$.
This  $x$ value is the projection of $n_i$
on the line  running  from {\em East} to {\em West}.  We divides
the examples based on the median value of the projection($x$),
then recurse on each half. Recursion on
$n$ initial
examples stops when a sub-region
contains less that  $M$ examples (e.g. 
$M=\sqrt{|n|}$).
Note that this process requires only $2*|n|$ distance comparisons
per level of recursion, which is far less than the $O(|n|^2)$
required by PCA~\cite{Du2008}
or other  algorithms such as K-Means~\cite{hamerly2010making}.

\subsection{Spectral Sampling}\label{sect:sample}
When the above clustering method terminates, our  sampling policy (which we will call $S_1$) is then applied:
\begin{quote}
$S_1$: Compile and execute one  configurations,  picked at random, from each leaf cluster.
\end{quote}
We use this sampling policy since, later in this paper, we show $S_1$ performs better than:
\bi
\item $S_2$: East-West sampling: compile and execute the {\em East,West} poles of the leaf clusters;
\item $S_3$: Exemplar sampling: compile and execute all items in all leaves and return the one
with lowest runtime score.
\ei
Note that $S_3$ is {\em not} a {\em minimal} sampling policy (since it executes all configurations). 
We use it here as one  baseline
against which we can compare the other, more minimal, sampling policies (note that, in the results
that follow, we also compare our 
sampling methods against another baseline--
using information gathered after executing
all configurations).

\subsection{Regression Tree Learning}
Using the data collected this way, we then use the CART regression tree learner \cite{breiman1984} to build a predictor for runtimes. Regression tree learners seek the attribute range split that most increases
our ability to make accurate predictions.
CART explores splits that divide $n$ samples  into   with $n_1$ and $n_2$ samples where each sample  has a  standard deviations on the target variable of $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$.
CART finds the ``best'' split; i.e. the one that minimizes $\frac{n_1}{n}\sigma_1 + \frac{n_2}{n}\sigma_2$.
Using this best split, CART divides the data, then recurses into each split.
 

The predictors built by CART  is then tested on data not used in the above spectral learning processing (see below for details). For each  test item, we find out how long it {\em actually} takes to run and compare that
to the {\em prediction} from CART. The resulting prediction error is then computed using:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:err}
\mathit{error}=\frac{\mathit{abs}(\mathit{predicted} - \mathit{actual})}{\mathit{actual}}*100
\end{equation}

\st{ote that our use of CART }
\section{Research Questions} 
In summary, WHAT is combines
(1) the FASTMAP method of Faloutsos and Lin~\cite{Faloutsos1995};
(2)~a spectral learning algorithm initially   inspired by    Boley's PDDP system~\cite{boley98}, which we modify
by replacing  PCA with FASTMAP (prior work have called this
method ``WHERE''~\cite{me12d});
(3)~the $S_1$ sample method that explores the leaf clusters found by this recursive division;
and (4)~the CART regression tree learner that converts the data from the samples collected by $S_1$
into a runtime prediction model~\cite{breiman1984}.
That is,
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcl}
WHERE& = &PDDP - PCA + FASTMAP\\ 
WHAT& =  & WHERE + $S_1$ + CART
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This combination of methods has not been previously explored in the
software engineering literature.


Hence, in that eigenspace, it might be true that only small
number of samples are required to explore it all.
On the other hand, a model built from a very small sample of the available data might
be very inaccurate and unstable; i.e. it exhibit very large mean errors and standard deviations on the error.

Also, if we learn models from very small regions of the training data,
then it is  possible that that learner will miss {\em trends} in that data
between the sample points. Such trends are useful when building {\em optimizers};
i.e. devices that input one configuration and propose an alternate
configuration that has (say) faster runtimes. Such optimizers might
need to evaluate hundreds to millions of alternate configurations. 
To speed up that process, optimizers can use a {\em surrogate model}\footnote{Also known as response surface methods, meta models, or emulators.}
that  mimic the outputs of a system of interest, while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate~\cite{loshchilov13}. For example, when optimizing
runtimes, we might ask the CART regression tree for a performance
prediction (rather than compile and execute
configurations).  Note that such surrogate-based
reasoning critically depends on how well the surrogate can guide optimization.

{\bf XXX Vivek: is there any overlap in the
configurations generated by the optimizer and the
examples used to train the surrogate}

{\bf XXX Vivek: check the regression tree branch with
fastest runtime. is the optimizer output
something that could be just read from that branch?}


Therefore, to assess our sampling policies, we must compare:
\bi
\item Performance scores (runtimes) generated from our minimal sampling policy;
\item The variance on the performance scores (to check for the stability
of those performance predictions);
\item The optimization support offered by the performance predictor.
\ei
The above concerns leads to four research questions:
\bi
\item {\bf RQ1:} {\em Can the WHAT  +$S_1$ spectral learning generate good predictions after only
executing a small number of configurations?}
\ei
Here, by ``good'' we mean that the predictions found via sampling with WHAT+$_S1$ are as good, or better,
as those generated from far more samples.
\bi
\item {\bf RQ2:} {\em
Does less data used in building the models lead to large variability in the predicted values?}
\item {\bf RQ3:} {\em
Can ``good'' surrogate models (to be used in optimizers)
be built from minimal samples?}
\ei
Note that {\bf RQ2,RQ3} are of particular concern with out approach
since we are sampling so little from the total space of possible
configurations.
\bi
\item {\bf RQ4:} {\em Compared to the start of the art in minimal sampling for
learning runtime predictors from product lines, how good is WHAT with $S_1$?}
\ei
To answer this last question, we will compare WHAT with $S_1$
           against the FW, PW, HO, HS methods of Seigmud et al. (described above in \tion{addit}).
 
\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Reproduction Package}

All the materials required to reproduce this work are available at \textcolor{red}{\url{https://github.com/ai-se/ActiveConfig_codebase}}.

\subsection{Case Study Materials}

This study explores feature models of the products lines listed in \fig{cpm}.
Also, to compare our results from minimal sub-sampling to those obtained 
from a larger sample, we use data sets showing the runtimes associated with
compiling and executing {\em nearly all} configurations\footnote{http://http://openscience.us/repo/performance-predict/cpm.html}.

We say {\em nearly all} configurations, for the following reasoning. For 
$\frac{5}{6}$ths of our case studies, the number of possible configurations
was not large (192 to 2560). However, the SQL product line has 3,932,160 
possible configurations-- which is an impractically large number of configurations to explore. Hence, for SQL, we use the 4500 samples that could
be collected in one day of CPU time (and, in the results shown below,
we will pay particular attention to the variance of the SQL results).

\subsection{Experimental Rig}

{\bf XXX vivek. all sqls should be sql lite}


 



{\bf RQ1,RQ2} require the construction and assessment of numerous runtime predictors from small samples
of the data. The following rig implements that construction process.

For each product line, we built a table of data, one row per legal configuration.
To this table we added a column showing the runtimes for each configuration.

Next, 20 times, we repeated the following procedure (the figure of 20 repeats was
selected using the central limit theorem). Note that the following rig ensures that
we never test any prediction model on the data used to build that model.
\bi
\item For each  product line in \{BDBC, BDBJ, Apache, SQLite, LLVM, x264\},
\bi
\item Randomized the order of the rows in their table of data;
\item For $X$ in \{10, 20, 30... , 90\};
\bi
\item Let {\em Train} be the first $X$\% of the data 
\item Let {\em Test} be the next 10\% of the data;
\item Pass {\em Train} to WHAT to find a sample of configurations;
\item Determine the runtimes associated with those configurations (in our rig, that is a table lookup and when
this approach is used in practice, this would entail compiling and executing the software product).
\item Using the {\em Train}  data (and their runtimes), build a defect predictor using CART.
\item Using {\em Test}, assess the predictor using the error measure of \eq{err}.
\ei
\ei
\ei
{\bf RQ2} required testing the standard deviation of the predictions. To support that test, we:
\bi
\item Found the $X$-th point in the above experiments where all predictions stop improving;
\item Measure the standard deviation of the error at that point, across our 20 repeats.
\ei
As shown below, all our results plateaued after studying $X=40$\% of the legal configurations
 \footnote{Just to clarify one frequently asked question about this work, we note
that our rig ``studies'' 40\% of the data, we do not mean that our predictive models
 require access to runtimes from the 40\% of the data. Rather, by ``study'' we mean   reflect 
 on a sample of configurations to determine what minimal subset of that
sample deserves to be compiled and executed.}.
 Hence to answer {\bf RQ2}, we will compare all 20 predictions at $X=40$\%$.
 
{\bf RQ3} requires using the regression tree learned in this way as a {\em surrogate model} within an optimization process. To study this research question, we:
\bi
\item Take   $X=40\%$ of the configurations;
\item Apply WHAT with $S_1$ to build a CART model using some minimal sample taken from that 40\%;
\item Used that CART model within some standard optimizers while searching for configurations with least runtime;
\item  Compare the faster configurations found in this manner with the fastest configuration
known for that product line.
\ei
This last item requires access to some ``ground truth'' of runtimes for a very
large number of configurations. For this experiment, we have access to that ground truth
(since we have access to nearly all the configurations. While that ground truth for this
validation study, we note that, once our methods satisfy this validation study,
they would not not be needed in if practitioners choose to use WHAT in their own work.

As to the optimizers used in this second experiment, for the sake of completeness, we explored
a range of optimizers (see~\fig{opt}).  Normally,
it would be  reasonable to ask
why we used those three, and not the hundreds of other 
optimizers described in the literature~\cite{flecther13,harman12}. However,
as shown below, all these optimizers in this
domain exhibited  very similar
behavior (all found configurations were very nearly
best case performance). Hence, the specific
choice of optimizer is not a critical
variable in  our analysis.

Evolutionary optimization algorithms
starts with an \textit{initial population} (randomly generated, based on some constraints). Since the solutions are drawn from a uniform distribution, typically, this diversity is desirable, although in some cases we might want to initialize all of the available parents to some best-known solution and proceed from there. The chosen \textit{evaluation function} must be capable of differentiating
between two individuals, i.e., it has to be able to rank one solution ahead
of another. Those solutions that are better, as determined by the evaluation
function, are favored to become parents for the next generation of offspring. 
A core function in evolutionary optimizers are the
\textit{reproduction} functions that generate   new solutions  probabilistically in the neighborhood of old solutions. This process continues till the a \"good enough\" solution is achieved or a hard limit on iterations are reached.  
    
    There has been extensive research in evolutionary algorithms in search-based software engineering.  For example, here is a list of search algorithms used widely in research: \textit{simulated annealing}\cite{bell2013limited, menzies2007business}; various genetic algorithms\cite{goldberg1979complexity} agumented by techniques such as
    (1)~smarter population subset selection~\cite{zit02,deb00afast};
    (2)~\textit{differential evolution} \cite{storn1997differential}
    (3)~\textit{tabu search and scatter search}\cite{nebro2008abyss, molina2007sspmo, glover1986general, beausoleil2006moss}; 
    (4)~\textit{particle swarm optimization}\cite{pan2008particle}; 
    (5)~numerous decomposition approaches that use heuristics to decompose the total space into small problems, then apply a response surface methods such
    as our own GALE\cite{krall2014gale,zuluaga2013active} algorithm.
    
    For this study, we applied three optimizers that are standards
    in the SE literature (NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast} and SPEA2~\cite{zit02})
    as well as our own GALE algorithm~\cite{krall2014gale}.
    GALE uses the WHERE algorithm to find a direction of most useful
    mutation. Given leaf clusters, each with an {\em East,West} point
    then 
    GALE mutates the population of candidates in that leaf cluster towards
    which of {\em East,West} has better evaluation scores. These
    mutants become the data  that is cluster
    and mutated by WHERE in  generation $i+1$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{RQ1 results}
{\em Can the WHAT  +$S_1$ spectral learning generate good predictions after only
executing a small number of configurations?}

\fig{sampling_accuracy} shows the mean errors of the predictors learned
after taking $X$\% of the configurations, then asking some WHAT and some sampling method
to (a)~find what configurations to execute; then (b)~asking CART to build a predictor
using that execution information. The horizontal axis of those plots show what $X$\%
of the configurations are studied and the vertical axis shows the mean relative error (from \eq{err}).
In that figure:
\bi
\item
The \textcolor{blue}{{\bf blue}} lines on \fig{sampling_accuracy} show a {\em baseline} result
where data from the runtimes of 100\% of  configurations from 0 to $X$ were used by CART
to build a runtime predictor.
\item
The other lines show the results using the sub-sampling methods defined in \tion{sample}.
Note that these sub-sampling methods only used  runtime data from
some subset of 100\% of the runtimes seen in configurations
from 0 to X\%.
\ei

{\bf XXX VIVEK: (1) are the WHERE random results at X=0.4 the same values as those on \fig{my-label}; \textcolor{red}{Yes}
(2) \st{pls change x axis to 20,40,60,80};(3) i still don't get the difference between where exemplar
and baseline given that baseline samples all}\textcolor{red}{Examplar uses one the best solution in a cluster as a sample, so the number of samples = number of clusters. But baseline uses all the members of all the clusters}

In  \fig{sampling_accuracy}, {\em lower} y-aixis values are {\em better} since this shows lower
prediction errors. Note that:
\bi
\item Some product lines exhibit large changes in their behavior, below $X=40$\% (see the BDBC and BDBJ
results).
\item Above $X=40$\%, there is little change in other overall change of the sampling methods.
\item
Nearly always, the {\em exempler} sampling method $S_3$ shows  highest overall error so it cannot be recommended.
\item Always, the  \textcolor{blue}{{\bf blue baseline}} results  had lowest errors-- which is to be
expected since predictors built in the baseline have access to all data.
\item
Usually, the error of the $S_1,S_2$ methods, are within $5$\% of the {\em baseline} results.
Hence, we can recommend these two minimal sampling methods.
\ei
\fig{Evaluations} comments on one which  of    $S_1$ or $S_2$ we should recommend.
This figure displays data taken from the $X=40$\% point of \fig{sampling_accuracy} and displays
how many runtimes of configurations are needed by our sub-sampling methods (while
reflecting on the configurations seen in the range $0\le X \le 40$. Note that:
\bi
\item
The {\em exemplar}
method needs up to thousands of runtime points, so it cannot be recommended as  minimal sampling
policy;
\item The $S_2$ {\em east-west} sampling policy needs twice as much runtime information as 
the $S_1$ {\em random} policy (since $S_2$ uses {\em two} samples per leaf cluster  while
$S_1$ only uses {\em one}).
\item $S_1$ only needs runtime information on a few dozen (or less) runtimes to generate
the predictions with the lower errors seen in \fig{sampling_accuracy}.
\ei
\st{\bf XXX VIVEK: need a log scale on the y-axis of \fig{Evaluations} } \textcolor{red}{I have changed the figure and I think it looks good. What do you think?}

Combining \fig{sampling_accuracy} and \fig{Evaluations} results, we conclude that:
\bi
\item
$S_1$ is our preferred spectral sampling method;
\item
The answer to {\bf RQ1} is ``yes'' since using WHAT+$S_1$ we can (a)~generate runtime predictors
using just a few dozens examples of runtimes; and (b)~those predictions have errors
within 5\% of the error seen if predictors built from information about all runtimes.
\ei

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/evaluation_graph.eps}
\caption{ Comparing evaluations of different approaches. }\label{fig:Evaluations}
\end{figure}


\subsection{RQ2 Results}

{\em
Does less data used in building the models lead to large variability in the predicted values?}

Two competing effects can lead to increased, or less,  variability  in 
runtime predictions:
\bi
\item
The less we sample a space,
the less we constrain model generation in that space. Hence, models learned
from too few samples can exhibit large variance (see the examples of that effect,
in the introduction). 
\item
On the other hand, a compensating effect can be introduced by sampling from eigenspace
since that space contains fewer confusing variables than that raw data.
\ei
\fig{Variance} reports which one of these two competing effects are dominate. 
This chart \fig{sampling_accuracy} shows that after some initial jumping around,
after seeing $X=40$\% of the data, the variability in predictions falls away to nearly zero.

{\bf XXX: vivek: need log scales for \fig{Variance} on the y axis. also is the y-axis variance or standard deviation.}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/Variance.eps}
\caption{Standard deviations seen at various points of  \fig{sampling_accuracy}.}\label{fig:Variance}
\end{figure}

Hence, we answer {\bf RQ2} as ``no'', selecting a small number of samples does not increase variance (at least to say, not in this domain).

\subsection{RQ3 Results}

 {\em
Can ``good'' surrogate models (to be used in optimizers)
be built from minimal samples?}

The answers to {\bf RQ1,RQ2} recommend the use of WHAT+$S_1$ to build runtime predictors from a very small sample
of the data. {\bf RQ3}
asks if that predictor can be used by an optimizer to infer what {\em other} configurations might generate very fast runtimes?
To answer this question, 20 times, we ran generated a random set of 100 configurations then based that baseline to three optimzers
(GALE and two other optimisers,  described in \ig{opt}). When those optimzers mutated existing configurations to suggest new ones,
those mutations were checked against the product lines. Any mutants that violated the product line constraints were rejected
and the survivors were ``evaluated'' by asking a surrogate
(the  CART regression tree learned from WHAT+$S_1$, built using the methods of {\bf RQ1}).
These evaluations either rejected the mutant or used it in generation $i+1$ as the basis for a search for more, possibly
better  mutants.

\fig{performance_graph} shows the configurations found by GALE projected onto the ``ground truth'' of the runtimes of nearly
all configurations. Note that while we use that ``ground truth'' for the validation of these results, our optimizers only
used a very small percent of that ground truth in their search for fastest configurations (see the {\em WHERE random}
results of \fig{Evaluations}).


\begin{figure}[!t]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/optimizer_result.eps}
\caption{Solutions found by GALE (shown as points) laid against the ground truth (all known configuration runtimes).}\label{fig:performance_graph}
\end{figure}

{\bf XXX vivek text around fig8 re sql is not ground truth}

The important feature of \fig{performance_graph} is that all the optimized configurations fall within 1\% of the fastest
configuration in the ground truth (see all the left-hand-side dots on each plot).. \fig{external_validity} compares GALE's performance to that of the two other optimizers
used in this study. Note that the performances are nearly identical which leads to two conclusions:
\be
\item The answer to {\bf RQ3} is ``yes''-- for optimizing runtimes, we can use surrogates built from very few runtime samples;
\item That first point is not critically effected by the choice of optimizer.

\subsection{RQ4 Results}
  
{\em Compared to the start of the art in minimal sampling for
learning runtime predictors from product lines, how good is WHAT with $S_1$?}

\input{tex/vs2102}

\fig{my-label} compares the errors found by  WHAT+ $S_1$ with those found by the minimal sampling
methods from prior work. Note that:
\bi
\item
Simple feature-wise (FW) sampling uses fewer samples that 
other methods, but its mean error and/or standard deviation can be largest. Hence, simple FW addition
of the known runtimes for each individual feature is less reliable that the other methods.
\item
As to the other minimal sampling methods  (PW,HO,HS)  WHAT+$S_1$ always had a   lower mean
error rate and a much lower standard deviation on the error.  
\item In terms of number of samples required to make those predictions, WHAT+$S_1$ needed
much less detail that PW or HO or HS
\ei

Hence, we answer {\bf RQ4} with ``yes''
since our minimal sampling method yields predictions that are far more accurate that prior
work (and does so using fewer samples).



 \section{Related Work}
 \subsection{``Spectral Clustering'' in the  Machine Learning Literature}\label{sect:related}
 
In 2000, Shi and Maik~\cite{shi00} claimed the term ``spectral clustering'' as a reference to their normalized cuts
image
segmentation algorithm that  partitions data through a spectral (eigenvalue) analysis of the  
Laplacian representation of the similarity graph between instances in the data.

In 2003, Kamvar et al.~\cite{kamvar2003spectral},  generalized that definition saying that ``spectral learners''
were any data mining algorithm that first replaced the raw
dimensions with those inferred from the spectrum (eigenvalues) of the affinity (a.ka. distance)
matrix of the data, optionally adjusted via some normalization technique).

Our
top-down divisive bi-clustering splits the data on a   approximation to an eigenvector, found at each recursive level
of the data (as described in \tion{spect}). 
Hence, this  method is a ``spectral clusterer'' in the general Kamvar-sense. 
Note that
for software engineering data, we have
not found that Kamvar's normalization matrixes are needed (but perhaps if we were text mining
on very large dimensional data, we would add in that normalization). 
 


\section{Reliability and Validity}\label{sect:construct}

{\em Reliability} refers to the consistency of the results obtained
from the research.  For example,   how well independent researchers
could reproduce the study? To increase external
reliability, this paper has taken care to either  clearly define our
algorithms or use implementations from the public domain
(SciKitLearn). Also, all the data used in this work is available
on-line in the PROMISE code repository and all our algorithms
are on-line at github.com/ai-se/where.

{\em Validity} refers to the extent to which a piece of research actually
investigates what the researcher purports to investigate.
{\em Internal validity} checks if the differences found in
the treatments can be ascribed to the treatments under study. 

One internal validity issue with our experiments is the choice
of {\em training and testing} data sets discussed in 
\tion{design}. Recall that while all our learners used the same
{\em testing} data set, our untuned learners were only given
access to {\em training}.

Another internal validity issues is {\em instrumentation}. The very low $\mu,\sigma$ error values
reported in this study are so small that it is reasonable to ask they are due to some instrumentation
quirk, rather than due to using a clever sample strategy:
\bi
\item
We note that our low $\mu$ values are consistent with prior work.  Sarkar et al.~\cite{sarkar2015cost} report their CART predictions
(learned using all configurations executed and the runtimes collected) had  errors of around 4\% (calculated using \eq{err}). Recall from our introduction that that  $\mu$ error values  seen with the methods of this paper
can be slightly more than 4\%-- which is to be expected since our predictive models were built using less
data. 
\item
As to our low $\sigma$ values, we note that when the  error values are so close to 0\%, the standard
deviation of the error is ``squeezed'' between zero and those errors. Hence, we would expect that
experimental rigs
that generate error values on the order of 5\% \eq{err} should have $\sigma$ values of $0\le \sigma \le 5$ (e.g. like those seen in our introduction).
\ei


XXX need some earlier notes on SQLlite \newline Another issues about {\em Internal validity}
Regarding SQLite, we cannot measure all possible configurations in reasonable time. Hence, we sampled only 100 configurations to compare prediction and actual performance values. We are aware that this evaluation leaves room for outliers.
Also, we are aware that measurement bias can cause false interpretations [20]. Since we aim at predicting performance for a special workload, we do not have to vary benchmarks.



{\em External validity}  We aimed at increasing the external validity by choosing programs from different domains with different configuration mechanisms and implemented with different programming languages. Furthermore, the programs used are deployed and used in real world. Nevertheless, assuming the evaluations to be automatically transferable  to all configurable programs is not fair. To further strengthen the external validity we run the model(generated by \textit{WHERE east west} against other searchers like NSGAII and differential evolution algorithms\cite{storn1997differential}. This is to validate teh fact that the model doesn't only work for GALE style of perturbation. In Table \ref{external_validity}, we see that the models developed is valid for all searchers, as all searchers are able to find the near optimal solutions.


{\bf XXXX vivek params earlier? in paper  }


{\bf XXXX vivek rewrite conclusin so it matches the stuff on page 2 (contributions) }


{\bf XXXX vivek fix fig 10 }

{\em Parameter Bias} 
For this study, we did not do extensive parameter tuning:
NSGA-II and DE were run using their default
settings while GALE was run using the settings that
worked well on the first model we studied, which were
then frozen for the rest of this study. As documented
above, those parameters were:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mu$ = 100: population size;
\item $\omega$ = $\mu$: minimum size leaf clusters;
\item $\lambda$ = 3: premature stopping criteria (sets the maximum
allowed generations without any improvement
on any objective).
\item $\delta$ = 1: the ``accelerator'' that encourages larger
mutations;
\item $\gamma$ = 1.5: the ``brake'' that blocks excessive mutation.
\end{itemize}

If this paper was arguing that these parameters were
somehow optimal, then it would be required to present
experiments defending the above settings. However, our
claim is less than that—we only aim to show that with
these settings, GALE does as well than standard searching
tools. In future work, we will explore other settings.




That said, there exist some class of data mining papers for which
tuning may not be required. Consider  Le Goues et al.'s 2012
ICSE paper that used a evolutionary program to learn
repairs to code~
in that paper was ``can we fix any of the known bugs?''. Note
that this criteria is a ``{\em competency}'' statement, and
not a ``{\em better than}'' statement (the difference being that
one is 
``can do'' and the other is ``can do better''). For such
competency claims, tuning is not necessary. However, as soon
as {\em better than} enters the performance criteria then this
becomes a race between competing methods. In such a race,
it is unfair to hobble one competitor with poor tunings.



\section{Conclusions}

We introduce three new sampling techniques called \textit{WHERE-east-west}, \textit{WHERE random} and \textit{WHERE exemplar} for performance-prediction of configurable systems. To evaluate and compare the techniques, we used prediction accuracy, run times and number of evaluations. We conducted empirical studies on six real-world configurable systems to determine an ideal sampling strategy for performance prediction of configurable software system. Our key findings are:
\bi
    \item{Clustering can also be used as a part of the process of sampling and can reduce the number of examples required to train a model}
    \item{Less data does help to build stable models since the variance is always lower than 6\%}
    \item{The model is stable enough so that any optimizer can use the model to find optimal configuration.}
    \item{Using extreme points of the first principle component is a good representative of the entire cluster.}
\ei

Our empirical findings are meant to help the stakeholders in finding optimal configurations to achieve the desired performance scores. Our approach has the following desirable properties:
\bi
\item{minimize the number of configurations which needs to be run. With systems with lot of configurable parameter out method can be very useful}
\item{flexible, since it can used with any number of configurations}
\ei
In the future...

\subsection{Implications}

time for an end to era of data mining in se? moving on to a new phase of learning-as-optimization

1) learning is actually an optimization tasks (e.g. see fig2 of  learners climbing the roc curve hill in http://goo.gl/x2EaAm)

2) our learners are all contorted to do some tasks X (e.g. minimize expected value of entropy), then we assess them on score Y (recall). which is nuts. maybe we should build the goal predicate into the learner (e.g http://menzies.us/pdf/10which.pdf) 

3) given 1 + 2, maybe the whole paradigm of optimizing param selection is wrong. maybe what we need is a library of bees buzzing around making random choices (e.g. about descritziation) which other bees use, plus their own random choices (e.g. max depth of tree learned from discretized data) which is used by other bees, plus their own random choices (e.g. business users reading the models).  the funky thing here is that it can take some time before some of the bees (the discretizers) get feedback from the community of people using their decision (the tree learners). 


of particular importance  since we are restraining our
model construction with very little data.

All too often,
 software becomes  a victim of its own success.
 Once users find software useful, they request modifications to better suite
 their particular needs.
 This in turn leads to change requests to support multiple platforms or
 numerous specialized use cases. 
 To accommodate all these  requests,
 developers build complex {\em configuration files} that 
 control how software is customized and compiled. 
 
 These configuration
 files can grow so complex that it becomes difficult
 to understand how all the combinations of all the 
 configurations effect the system\cite{berger2013study}. 
Xu et.al \cite{xu2015hey} reports that users face tremendous difficulties to find the right configurations from the large configuration space. 

 In order for  users to find  optimal configurations for a particular job/functionality, they need an understanding of the dependencies between various configuration or perform an exhaustive search of all the configuration options. 
 A manual or exhaustive search of all those options
 is impractical; e.g.    an execution of all combinations of
 $n$ binary options results in  $2^n$   configurations, each of which might need compilation and tested. 
 
In practice,  not all $2^n$ configurations are valid; e.g. it makes no sense
 to configure a password encryption algorithm if a particular system is to be run inside a firewall (and so all passwords are disabled).  However, even after constraining option experimentation to just the valid combinations,
 the   runtimes required to (say) find the fastest configuration can be very long. 
 For example, the software runtime data used in this paper required  26 days of CPU to collect (and much longer, if we also count the time required
 for compiling the code prior to execution). 
 Other researchers have commented that,  in 
 real world scenarios, the cost of acquiring optimal configuration is overly expensive and time consuming \cite{weiss2008maximizing}.
 
 
 One way to reduce the time required to find an optimal configuration, is  to build an approximation of the software system that  can accurately 
 \bi
 \item {\em Predict} the  performance  of the software system (without having to actually execute the system). 
 \item {\em Optimize} that performance; i.e. extrapolating from that small sample, infer what other configurations   result in better  performance. 
\ei
Ideally, these {\em prediction} and {\em optimization} models can be build with least effort via  some {\em minimized sampling} across the space of possible configurations.
This paper proposes 
a novel {\em minimized sampling} policy, called   WHAT\footnote{WHAT is based on the WHERE learner~\cite{menzies2013local} and its name is short for ``Where u at''?} that recursively divides the space of configurations in two
until {\em leaves} are found of size $\sqrt{N}$ of the original data.
WAT then times how long it takes to executes software
built from two  samples selected at random from  each leaf. The resulting data is then
used to build a runtime predictor.  To assess the value of this approach, we ask three
research questions:
   
            {\bf RQ1:} {\em Can runtime prediction systems  be built using just a very small sample of configurations?} (in our case,  selected by WAT)
            In the following, we compare the number of samples used by WAT
              to the prior state of the art in this field: a pairwise sampling method proposed at ICSE'12 by Seigmund et al.~\cite{siegmund2012predicting}. 
              We show that WAT requires  25\% to 50\% fewer samples than that  prior
 work. The resulting sample sizes are very small indeed. For example, instead of exploring
 the millions of configurations available for SQL, WAT learns good runtime predictors using
 just 64 executions.
            
            {\bf RQ2:} {\em Does less data used in building the models lead to less
            effective predictions?}  This is a concern since the {\em less} you sample data,
            the {\em less} you constrain a model built from those samples. Therefore,
            our pre-experimental concern with WAT was that it would sample too
            little, thus resulting in an under-constrained prediction model that generated
            wildly varying predictions.  This paper finds that  WAT's predictions are effective in both the absolute and relative sense. Compared to those of 
            Seigmund et al., WAT's  errors are small (less than 10\% relative
            to the actual) while in relative terms, our preidcions are 
 four to sixteen times more accurate that those of Seigmund et al. (measured in terms of mean or standard deviations of the errors)
          
          {\bf RQ3:} {\em Can optimizers use prediction models of runtimes
            to infer what other configurations result in better  performance?} 
           Another issue with reasoning from very small samples is that it is
           possible to overlook some important
           part of the phenomena being studied; e.g. the configuration that
           leads to fastest runtimes. Hence, it is important to check if those
           faster configurations can be inferred from (say) the 64 sampled configurations
           we explored for SQL. To this end, we (a)~built runtime predictors using, say, 64 samples then (b)~used those predictors to guide optimizers looking for faster
           configurations (whenever
           the optimizer had to assess a new configuration, it   asked the predictive
           model). When compared to  a ``ground truth'' library containing up to thousands of executed configurations, the configurations found in this way were always amongst the fastest items seen within the ``ground truth''.
           

 \subsection{Contributions of this Paper}
 Prior work on building  approximations for the runtime behavior of software systems has explored {\em prediction}~\cite{guo2013variability,siegmund2012predicting,westermann2012automated,sarkar2015cos,zhang2015performance}
 but not {\em optimization}. In a  brute force approach, analysts  explore a large number
 of configurations, collecting runtimes for each one.
 Using that brute force approach,  it is possible to learn a decision tree that very accurately {\em predicts} the runtime of new configurations~\cite{guo2013variability}. 
 When  brute force is impractical,  
 various {\em minimized sampling} policies can be applied.  Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2015performance} approximate the
 systems as a Fourier series, after which they can derive an expression showing how many configurations must be studies
 to build predictive models with error $\epsilon$. While a theoretically satisfying result, that approach still needs thousands to hundreds of thousands of sample runtimes. In 2012,  Seigmund et al.~\cite{siegmund2012predicting} proposed heuristic
 sampling methods such as pair-sampling (where no pair of 
 variable settings should appear in more than one configuration). The  Seigmund et al. approach  requires far fewer runs than a Fourier-based analysis (dozens to hundreds of samples) but the results were highly unstable (large variances
 in the percent errors).

 
 This paper proposes {\em WAT}:  a novel minimized sampling method.
 WAT uses a top-down bi-clustering algorithm to splits  configurations in half along a line
drawn between two  distant configurations (and by ``distant'', we mean least number of
identical configuration options). 
WAT then recurses on each half, stopping when a split is {\em final};
i.e. it contains fewer than some  $\mathit{MIN}$ minimum number of configurations (e.g $\mathit{MIN}=\sqrt{N}$ of
the number of possible configurations).
On termination, WAT finally returns two randomly selected configurations per final split,
from which:
\bi
\item We can build a {\em predictive} model;
\item Drive an {\em optimizer} that uses the predictive model to infer what other configurations result in better performance.
\item Which is all done using {\em minimized sampling} of the possible evaluations;
e.g. if $\mathit{MIN}=\sqrt(N)$ then WAT needs only $2\sqrt{N}$ samples).
\ei
This paper shows that {\em WAT} is better than the state-of-the-art system
previously propse by Seigmund et al. The predictions learned from WAT's
samples are more   accurate (i.e. low mean error) and  more stable (i.e. low standard deviation):
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rr@{~}lr@{~}l}
         & \multicolumn{2}{c}{usual case} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{worst case} \\
  Source & \multicolumn{2}{c}{(50th percentile)}    & \multicolumn{2}{c}{(100th percentile)} \\\hline
 Seigmund et al. &  $7.4$& $\pm \;10$\%  &  $44.0$ & $\pm 42.3$\%\\
WAT &  $6.1$& $\pm \;\;0.6$\% &  $9.9$&  $\pm$~~ $6.8$\%\\\hline
ratios   & 1.2 & ~~~~16.7          & 4.4 & ~~~~~~6.2
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
In the above $X \pm Y$ shows mean and  standard deviation values seen across various trials. Note that
 WAT's mean errors are   1.2 to 4.4 times smaller and
 the standard deviations are 16.7 to 6.2   times smaller than the prior state of the art in this 
 research area.
 
Apart from generating more accurate and stable predictions,  
another reason to recommend WAT is that, compared to all the methods described above~\cite{%
siegmund2012predicting,%
zhang2015performance,%
guo2013variability,%
westermann2012automated,%
sarkar2015cos}
WAT requires
the least number  samples for prediction and optimization.
For example WAT requires  around   $\frac{1}{4}$th to $\frac{1}{2}$th
of the samples needed by  Seigmund et al.

\begin{comment}


Given two distant configurations $C_0,C_1$ in a final split,
we compile and execute $C_0,C_1$ then mutate  all
all configurations in that split towards the fastest one. This method can hence infer configurations
not seen in the original, sample that that run even faster than any example in that sample.
We show below that this optimizer can find some of the fastest possible configurations for the systems
studied here.
 
 
Our goal is to build performance models that can be trained using the few training samples, which then can be used, along with a fast optimizer, to find optimal configuration of the system (for eg. minimize run time of a job).  To further emphasize that it is expensive to collect complete configuration space (exhaustive search), let us look at an example. Assume that there is a software system with 9 features (configuration space = $2^9$) and a job requires at an average 20 minutes to execute. The total time required to find an optimal configuration, using exhaustive search, is 4300 minutes ($2^9 \times 20$). This problem can be solved in a short amount of time, if the user can build a performance model with fewer samples ($\ll 2^n$). From a learner perspective, our goal can be described as a sampling technique, which can determine "good sample" for a given system. A "good sample" can be described as a sample if it is small enough to decrease the measurement effort and large enough to increase the prediction accuracy of the model. We propose three new sampling techniques, which uses a clustering technique and use point/s from clusters to build the sample set. We conduct experiments on six real-world configurable system to compare the sampling strategies in terms of total time saved by the sampling techniques wrt. to the baseline strategy ($2/3$ of the sample size).

 \section{Misc-- not sure we need to use}
 
 The big question for your approach is, however, how should we rate the quality (e.g., accuracy, feasibility, usefulness) of a solution (i.e., the estimated optimal configuration) 
\bi
\item Valid;
\item Compared with ground truth.
\ei
The first point can be addressed using {\em feature models} which are a lightweight notation
for describing valid combinations of configurations within a  system~\cite{kang1990feature}. In the rig
described below, our optimizer is programmed to reject all configurations that violate
feature models describing valid Makefile settings.

As to the second point, to generate that ground truth we can generate and compile and execute
a  very large set of configurations. Within that set, there exists some fastest runtime $T_0$--
and we would assert our optimizer is useful if it can recommend a system that executes
with time $T_1 \approx T_0$.

As an aside, we note that when discussing this rig with colleagues, they ask if we have the ground truth, why do any optimizations? The answer is that the validation rig used
in this paper is {\em different} to how this this method would be applied {\em after}
it has been validated. It is true that to {\em validate} this approach, we must compile
and execute hundreds to thousands (or more) variations of the Makefiles. Using that information,
we can test what would happen if:
\bi
\item We sample just a few variations (say, $N=64$ or less);
\item Then build an optimizer to study those variations is order to propose a best, most fastest configuration;
\item Then compile that proposed configuration to find $T_1$ (the runtime of the compiled code generated from that proposed configuration).
\ei
To assess $T_1$, we need to compare it to the $T_0$ (the  the fastest runtime of any configuration). Hence, to validate the rig, we need many configurations. However, given the results of this paper, we assert that it
in practice, it
would be acceptable to quickly sample (say) $N=64$ configurations (selected in an intelligent manner,  using the methods described below).

\section{Background}

\textbf{Feature Maps}

    \textbf{Sampling: } Figure ~\ref{fig:GeneralProcess} illustrates the general process of performance prediction using sampling. It starts with an initial sample of measured configurations, which are used to build the prediction model. A good initial sample significantly reduces the effort involved with training sample collection. The boxes in yellow describes the current state of the art sampling process, where as the boxes in grey are the new approach proposed in the paper. 
    
    The state of the art approaches involves progressive and projective sampling techniques \cite{sarkar2015cost} and Fourier Transforms \cite{zhang2015performance}. However these approaches assumes the user to know a lot of about the system, which is not a fair assumption. The problem with iterative techniques lies in the step size, which is an engineering decision(aka black art). In our approach, we use clustering, which uses the first principle component, to determine clusters rather than relying to random sampling methods. Once the clusters are obtained, \'interesting\' representative/s from each cluster  is/are collected. Then these points are used to build prediction models using a statistical learning technique called Classification and Regression Tree (CART), which has been demonstrated to be fast and accurate for performance prediction of configurable system \cite{guo2013variability}.
    
In our work, we use the time saved by the proposed sampling when compared to the exhaustive search is presented along with the prediction accuracy (similar to ~\cite{guo2013variability}, \cite{siegmund2012predicting}, \cite{westermann2012automated}).

\end{figure}


    \textbf{Search Algorithms: }Linear time algorithms works well, when the problem scenario is same as the scenarios where the algorithm was developed. But in the real work scenario, the scenarios presented are slightly different from what the algorithms were developed in. For example, one particular technique is available to calculate the minimum-cost allocation of resources for a problem where both the cost function and constraints are linear. The method is fast and reliable. And it is almost applied inappropriately  in real-world settings where the cost function and constraints are almost always nonlinear. In essence, anyone using this method runs the risk of generating the right answer to a problem that does not exist \cite{michalewicz2013solve}.

\section{Problem Formulation}


    Configurations of a software system may not be independent, such that we cannot measure arbitrary configurations. Researchers have explored the presence of complex domain dependencies. With constraint between features, in theory there can be multiple minimal configuration (for example, in the presence of mutually exclusive features). These dependencies are captured well by \textit{Feature Models(FM)}. FM defines all the N features and all the valid configurations C of a software system. Figure ~\ref{fig:bdbc}  shows the feature model of Berkeley DB(C Version) using the notations defined in ~\cite{kang1990feature}, ~\cite{guo2012consistency}. A feature model defines all valid feature combinations of a customizable system. As shown in the figure a feature model can be presented as a tree like structure that defines relationships among features. The model can be used to check the validity of the solution produced during the mutation phase of the learners.
    
\begin{figure}[!t]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/BDBC.eps}
\caption{ Berkeley database feature model   (``C'' version). }\label{fig:bdbc}
\end{figure}
    
    The features on the software system is represented as a set of binary decision variables. A feature, when turned on, corresponds to 1, and 0 otherwise. All the features of a system is represented a vector F = $<f_1, f_2, ...,f_N>$, where N is the number of features of the software system. The dependent variable corresponding to a configuration(F) is a performance score, P(F), which the performance measurement.

    Performance of system can be modelled using the configuration as the independent variable and the performance metric as a dependent variable. 
    Modelling a software system is to find a hypothesis function(h), such that h(F) predicts P(F) accurately. This can be represented as:\\
\begin{center}
    $ h: C \mapsto \rm I\!R$ s.t. $L(h(F), P(F))$ is minimized\\
\end{center}

where, L is a loss function for penalizing errors in prediction. By formulating the performance prediction using the method described, we can transform the problem into a learning problem. 
    It should be noted that though the number of possible configurations (C) is equal to $2^N$(binary decision variables), in reality valid configurations(\^{C}) is smaller than C (|C| << |\^C|). 


To answer our research questions, we use data set from our previous work on detecting performance interactions~\cite{SKR+12}. It contains performance measurements of real-world configurable software systems.
These systems were selected to cover a broad range of domains (databases, Web servers, video encoder, compiler), programming languages (C, C++, Java), and different sizes regarding number of features and configurations. Table~\ref{tab:subjectsystems} provides an overview of these systems.
 
 
The data in these
data sets have a continuous class (run time of the compiled system)
so the performance of a quality predictor can be measured in terms
of difference between the predicted runtime $p$ of test case items
and their actual runtimes $a$ using 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
MRE = \frac{abs(s-a)}{a} \times 100
\end{equation}


For all systems, except for SQLite, we obtained the whole population data (i.e., all valid configurations). For SQLite, we measured all configurations corresponding to one-way and two-way interactions and additionally sampled 100 random configurations.

To evaluate our approach, we  implemented our techniques in Python and run it against data constructed from real-world software systems across different domains.

\subsection{Approach}
This section describes how a large space of candidate solutions (configurations) is clustered into many smaller clusters.
\subsubsection{WHERE Learning}\label{sec:spectral}


WHERE is a {\em spectral learner}~\cite{kamvar2003spectral}; i.e. given solutions with $d$ possible decisions(features), it re-expresses those $d$ decision variables in terms of the $e$ eigenvectors of that data.
This speeds up the reasoning since we then only need to explore the $e\ll d$   eigenvectors.

A widely-used spectral learner is a principal components analysis (PCA). For example, PDDP ({\em Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning})~\cite{boley1998principal} recursively partitions data according to the median point of data projected onto the first PCA component of the current partition.

WHERE~\cite{me12d} is a linear time variant of PDDP  
that uses FastMap~\cite{Faloutsos1995} to quickly find the first component.
Platt~\cite{platt05} shows that FastMap is a  Nystr\"om algorithm that finds approximations to eigenvectors.
As shown in \fig{fastmapCode} on lines 3,4,5, FastMap  projects all data onto a line connecting two distant points(poles)\footnote{
To define distance, WHERE uses the standard Euclidean distance method proposed by Aha et al.~\cite{aha91}; that is: $dist(x,y)= \sqrt{\sum_{i\in d} (x_i - y_i)^2}/\sqrt{ \left\vert{d}\right\vert }$ where distance is computed on the independent decisions $d$ of each candidate solution; all $d_i$ values are normalized min..max, 0..1; and the calculated distance normalized by dividing by the maximum distance across the $d$ decisions.}. 
FastMap finds these two distant points in near-linear time. 
The search for the poles needs only $O(N)$ distance comparisons (lines 19 to 24).
The slowest part of this search is the sort used to find the median $x$ value (line 10) but even that can be reduced to  asymptotically optimal linear-time via the standard median-selection algorithm~\cite{hoare61}.

\begin{figure}[!t] 
\begin{minipage}{3.2in}

  "Project data on a line to 2 distant points"

  west       = furthest(east, data)

  for one in data.members: 
    one.pos = project(west,east,c,one)
  data = sorted(data) # sorted by 'pos'

  "Project x onto line east to west"

def furthest(x,data): # what is furthest from x?
  out, max = x,0
  for y in data:
    d = dist(x,y)
    if d > max: out, max = y, d
  return out

def split(data): # Split at median
   mid = len(data)/2; 
  return data[mid:], data[:mid]
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Splitting data with FastMap}
\label{fig:fastmapCode}  
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

FastMap returns the data split into two equal halves.
WHERE recurses on the two halves, terminating when some split has less than $\sqrt{N}$ items. To summarize, the WHERE module of the technique takes data points as inputs and returns $2^{(1+log(\sqrt{N})))}$ number of clusters.

Next two subsections describes various technique of selecting points in such a way that the point select is an representative of the cluster

\subsubsection{WHERE Exemplar}\label{where_exemplar}
This technique borrows from WHERE spectral learner discussed above and uses the clusters to perform clustering. WHERE splits the data into smaller clusters, each of which is characterized by two distant points (poles). 
 The technique assumes the best point (exemplar) as the representative of each cluster. This technique uses one solution from each cluster(best) and hence $2^{(1+log(\sqrt{N})))}$ number of training examples, where M is the size of the configuration space.

\subsubsection{WHERE East West}\label{where_east_west}
This technique as the above technique is also uses the WHERE spectral learner as a precursor to sampling. 
It is assumed  that the technique only needs to evaluate
the most informative subset consisting of the poles used to
recursively divide the data. The recursive binary division of the solutions(M), and that this technique uses two solutions in each cluster, which means the technique uses only $2*2^{(1+log(\sqrt{N})))}$.

\subsubsection{WHERE Random}\label{where_random}
This technique uses WHERE spectral learner to cluster the data points and randomly chooses a point from the clusters. It is assumed that a random point in the cluster can be used as a representative to all the points in cluster. This technique only requires to one evaluation per cluster and hence $2^{(1+log(\sqrt{N})))}$ number of training examples.\\

We use the points sampled, using the technique described above, to build the predictive model using the popular machine learning technique called Classification and Regression Tree(CART), which has been extensively used in the literature and has been observed to be fast and accurate~\cite{guo2013variability}.



\textit{A. Can a reasonable prediction accuracy be achieved based on 
subset of a training set?}\\
\\
Figure ~\ref{fig:sampling_accuracy} show us how accuracy measured in terms of MRE, measure when the size of the dataset used is varied. X-axis represents the size of the dta used as a training set. For eg. Apache has 192 instances (all possible combinations), when 20\% of the data is used. It means 38 instances are chosen at random(without replacement) and this subset of the dataset is used as an input to the sampling techniques. In the figure we see that WHERE east-west and WHERE random are achieving the same accuracy, while WHERE exemplar is consistently performing worse than the other methods. We also observe is sampling on 40\% of the data is enough to model the configuration space. 

Since our objective is to reduce th enumber of examples required to train a model, it is important to compare the number of examples required to train a model(CART). In figure ~\ref{fig:Evaluations}, we see that WHERE random and WHERE east-west use far less number of evaluations as compared to the WHERE exemplar. From this point forward we don't consider WHERE exemplar while comparing different approaches, since it requires more number of evaluations and don't do as well as other techniques. 

Figure ~\ref{fig:Runtimes} shows that WHERE random and WHERE east-west, both techniques require less than 10\% and 20\% (when compared to exhaustive search) respectively. The numbers on the top of the cluster bars are the total time required to perform an exhaustive search. For eg. to execute all the possible combinations of configuration of Apache requires 78 hours, where  WHERE random can build a model in less that 5 hours.

\caption{ Comparing the runtimes of two promising approaches }\label{fig:Runtimes}
\end{figure}


\textit{B. Does less data used in building the models lead to large
variance in the predicted values?}\\

We have shown with sufficient evidence that models can be trained using less data, while achieving the accuracy
attained by using larger training data. 
The another aspect, which needs to be considered at this point is the variability that is introduced  when a sampled dataset used to train CART. 
Figure ~\ref{fig:Variance} shows the variance is under 10\%, when our sampling techniques use at least X\% of the data. Note that,


In Figure \ref{fig:time_saved}, we show the amount of time saved by various sampling methods. The x-axis of the graph represent the percentage of data used to build the CART model. The y-axis shows the time saved by the various sampling methods. There are take away from the figure are:
\bi
    \item{The sampled population remains constant even if the amount of training set increases. This shows that the method is scalable and only depends on the number of features in the dataset rather than the number of rows.}
    \item{From the previous sections, we know that \textit{WHERE east west} achieves 'almost' same accuracy,
    which mean the technique saves time while preserving accuracy and reducing variability.}
\ei


These results, along with the fact that the size of the sampled population is smaller compared to the configuration space, shows us that the \textit{WHERE east west} can indeed save time and effort, when the cost of collecting training samples is expensive.

\section{Fast Searcher: GALE}
Once we have the software performance model build using any sampling technique, the obvious next step is to find the optimal configuration such that the performance score of that particular configuration is the minimal. At this point, we can use any searcher to find the optimal configuration of a system(modelled by CART). In this section, we introduce GALE, which has proven to find near optimal solution with minimum model evaluations as possible. 
\subsection{Approach}
\begin{figure}[!b]
\small
\begin{tabular}{|p{.95\linewidth}|}\hline
GALE initially builds a population of points by selecting decisions at random. It then {\em clusters} those decisions into neighborhoods as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find two distant points in that population; call them the {\em east} and {\em west} poles. 
\item Draw an axis of length $c$ between the poles. 
\item Let each point be at distance $a,b$ to the {\em east,west} poles.  Using the cosine rule, project each point onto the  axis  at $x=(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)/(2c)$.  
\item Using the median $x$ value, divide the population.
\item For each half that is larger than $\sqrt{N}$ of the original population, go to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the above requires a distance measure between sets of decisions: GALE uses the standard case-based reasoning measure defined by Aha et al.~\cite{aha91}. Note also that GALE implements step1 via  the FASTMAP~\cite{Faloutsos1995} linear-time
heuristic:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pick any point at random; 
\item Let {\em east} be the point furthest from that point; 
\item Let {\em west} be the point furthest from {\em east}.
\end{itemize}

These final sub-divisions found by this process are the {\em neighborhoods} that GALE will {\em perturb} as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Find the objective scores of the {\em east,west} poles in each neighborhood.
\item Using the continuous domination predicate of \fig{moea}, find  the {\em better} pole. 
\item Perturb all points in that neighborhood by pushing them towards the better pole, by a distance  $c/2$ (recall that  $c$ is the distance between the poles).
\item Let generation $i+1$ be the combination of all pushed points from all neighborhoods.
\end{itemize}

From a formal perspective, GALE is an active learner~\cite{Dasgupta2005} that builds a piecewise linear approximation to the Pareto frontier~\cite{Zuluaga:13}.  
For each piece, it then pushes the neighborhood up the local gradient.  This  approximation is built in the reduced dimensional space found the FASTMAP  Nystr\"om approximation to the first component of PCA~\cite{platt05}.

\end{figure}
GALE combines (a) the neighborhood perturbation  with (b)~the MOEA algorithm of \fig{moea}.  The algorithm reflects over a {\em population} of points, each of which contains {\em decisions} (configurations of a software system).  It then searches for the input decisions that lead to best outcomes.  For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item we adjust the inputs to CART (modelling the performance score of the software system)
\item GALE can report the best configuration for the system such that the performance score is (near) lowest.
\end{itemize}

\fig{gale} lists the procedure by which GALE clusters the data into neighborhoods, then perturbs each neighborhood.  In terms of monitoring for brittleness, the key point of GALE is that this process continues until the perturbations stop having any new effect (i.e. they stop generating lower performance scores). That is, all GALE solutions are guaranteed not to be brittle.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\small
\begin{tabular}{|p{.95\linewidth}|}\hline
An evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm requires at least two  operators:
{\em cull} and {\em perturb}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate an initial population by randomly selecting decisions;
\item {\em Cull} the individuals with the lower objective scores.
\item Generate a new population $P_n$ by {\em perturbing} the decisions of the surviving individuals (e.g. via random mutation or grafting together parts of the decisions of different individuals)
\item Halt if $P_n$ no better than prior generations $P_{m<n}$.
\item Else, go to step 2.
\end{enumerate}
One way to implement the culling (step 2) is via {\em domination}; i.e. remove one example if it can be shown that it is worse that (a.k.a. ``is dominated by'') some other examples. 

Two forms of domination are {\em binary} and {\em continuous} domination.  In {\em binary domination}, one individual $x$ dominates $y$ if all $x$'s objectives are never worse than  the objectives in  $y$ but at least one objective in solution $x$ is better than its counterpart in $y$; i.e.
\[ \begin{array}{c}
\left\{ 
     \forall o_j  \in \textit{objectives}\;\mid\; \neg ( o_{j,x} \prec o_{j,y}) \right\} 
\\
 \left\{
\exists o_j \in \textit{objectives} \;\mid\; o_{j,x} \succ y_{j,y}\right\}
\end{array}\]
 where ($\prec,\succ$) tests if an objective score in one individual is (worse,better) than in the other individual.

An alternate culling method is the {\em continuous domination} predicate~\cite{Zitzler04indicator-basedselection} that favors $y$ over $x$ if $x$ ``losses'' least: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cdom}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\textit{worse}(x,y)& =& \textit{loss}(x,y) > \textit{loss}(y,x)\\
\textit{loss}(x,y)& = &\sum_j^n -e^{\Delta(j,x,y,n)}/n\\
\Delta(j,x,y,n) & = & w_j(o_{j,x}  - o_{j,y})/n
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where  ``$n$'' is the number of objectives and $w_j\in \{-1,1\}$ depending on whether we seek to maximize goal $x_J$.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Inside an MOEA.}\label{fig:moea}
\end{figure}

In terms of reducing runtime, the key feature of GALE is that unlike traditional MOEA methods such as NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast}, GALE  does not automatically generate objective scores for all $N$ decisions.  Instead, as it recursively clusters the data in two (using steps 1,2,3,4,5 in \fig{gale}), GALE only computes the objective scores for the two most distant points in each division.  This means that this binary division of the data terminates after a comparison of just $log_2(N)$ evaluated individuals. This is much less than the $2N$ comparisons required by  traditional methods like NSGA-II.

The perturbing module of GALE was modified for this problem. Since this problem has a constrained solution space, the perturbing module was made sensitive by including the feature model so, that GALE can recognize invalid solutions . If the solution generated after perturbing the solution, is not a valid solution, the solution is not considered for future perturbation.

\subsection{Results}



We try to answer the following research question in this section\\

\textit{C. Can evolutionary algorithms be used to find the optimal
configurations using the model generated?}
\\
Figure ~\ref{fig:performance_graph} presents the results after running GALE with the performance model. The figure shows the distribution of the performance score (sorted in the ascending order). In the figure we would like to show that GALE has been able to find the configuration/s with (almost)minimal performance scores. The graph shows the distribution of the scores.  At this point, we would like to point out the GALE doesn't always find the optimal solutions but find solutions close to the optimal. For example, GALE is about to find the third best configuration for SQL lite. The blue, red and yellow dot represents the 25, 50 and 75 percentile solutions found by GALE. It is to be noted that the solutions found by GALE are relatively stable(variance of the solutions found are low) and is very close to the actual medium. For SQL, the solutions found couldn't be compared with the ground truth since the configurations were not available(given that an exhaustive search was not possible since number of configurations is 39). We show here that using the software model build using \textit{WHERE random}, we have been able near optimal solution. Similar results can be found by models build using the \textit{WHERE east-west}. We believe that this further validates the usefulness of our approach.
